    "summary": "Today's cybersecurity landscape saw significant developments, particularly with the identification of critical vulnerabilities in SolarWinds and Docker. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added multiple flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, including a critical RCE vulnerability in SolarWinds Web Help Desk, which is currently being exploited. Additionally, Docker faced a severe flaw leading to remote code execution and potential data theft. Microsoft issued warnings about expanding Python infostealers targeting macOS, highlighting the evolving threat landscape. Meanwhile, the cyber startup Orion Security secured $32 million in funding to enhance its AI-driven data loss prevention solutions, underscoring the growing focus on AI in cybersecurity. Overall, the day was marked by a mix of emerging threats and proactive measures in the cybersecurity domain.",
