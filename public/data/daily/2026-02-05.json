    "summary": "Today's cybersecurity news highlights a critical vulnerability in the n8n workflow automation platform (CVE-2026-25049) that allows for arbitrary command execution, posing significant risks for users. Additionally, a web traffic hijacking campaign exploiting React2Shell has been identified, targeting NGINX servers to reroute traffic. In other developments, concerns have been raised about the rise of AI-driven phishing attacks, which are evolving to bypass traditional security measures. The ongoing issues surrounding data sovereignty and the risks posed by ungoverned AI agents were also discussed, emphasizing the need for better governance and control over data and AI usage.",
