    "summary": "Today's cybersecurity landscape saw significant developments, particularly with the use of AI in cyberattacks. Google reported that state-backed hackers, including those from North Korea, are leveraging its Gemini AI for reconnaissance and malware coding. Meanwhile, the Lazarus Group has been linked to malicious packages in npm and PyPI, targeting developers through fake recruitment campaigns. In data breach news, Dutch telecom provider Odido disclosed a breach affecting 6.2 million customers, while ApolloMD reported a breach impacting 626,000 individuals. Additionally, Apple patched multiple zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in sophisticated attacks, emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance in software security. CISA is also seeking industry feedback on incident reporting regulations, highlighting the evolving regulatory landscape in cybersecurity.",
