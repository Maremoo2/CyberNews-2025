    "summary": "Today's cybersecurity landscape saw significant developments, including the compromise of over 900 Sangoma FreePBX instances due to web shell attacks exploiting a command injection vulnerability. Additionally, a new malicious Go module has been identified that steals passwords and deploys a Linux backdoor. The ManoMano data breach has impacted 38 million customers, highlighting ongoing supply chain vulnerabilities. In regulatory news, Samsung has agreed to enhance its privacy practices following a lawsuit in Texas regarding data collection practices. Furthermore, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued warnings about the RESURGE malware, which can remain dormant on infected devices, and announced leadership changes amid scrutiny. Lastly, a critical Cisco vulnerability has prompted a joint alert from multiple nations, emphasizing the global nature of cybersecurity threats.",
