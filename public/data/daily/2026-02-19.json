    "summary": "Today's cybersecurity landscape saw significant developments, particularly in data breaches and vulnerabilities. The French government reported a major breach affecting 1.2 million bank accounts, highlighting the ongoing risks to financial data security. In the U.S., a ransomware attack on the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes led to extortion threats following the shutdown of schools and critical systems. Additionally, new vulnerabilities were disclosed, including a critical flaw in Windows Admin Center (CVE-2026-26119) and a serious issue in Grandstream VoIP phones (CVE-2026-2329) that could allow unauthorized access. The emergence of PromptSpy, the first Android malware utilizing generative AI, marks a concerning evolution in mobile threats. Overall, today's news underscores the persistent and evolving nature of cyber threats across various sectors.",
