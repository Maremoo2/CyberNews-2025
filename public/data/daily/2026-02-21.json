    "summary": "Today's cybersecurity landscape was marked by significant incidents involving AI-assisted attacks and vulnerabilities. A Russian-speaking threat actor exploited generative AI to compromise over 600 FortiGate devices across 55 countries, highlighting the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. Additionally, a critical vulnerability in Grandstream phones (CVE-2026-2329) was reported, allowing for remote code execution and interception of calls. The cybersecurity sector also faced turmoil as stocks plummeted following the announcement of Anthropic's new security tool, which offers vulnerability scanning capabilities, raising concerns among investors. Meanwhile, a ransomware attack disrupted healthcare services in Mississippi, emphasizing the ongoing threat to critical infrastructure. Lastly, researchers uncovered a new Android malware, PromptSpy, which utilizes generative AI to evade detection, showcasing the intersection of AI and malware development.",
