    "summary": "Today's cybersecurity landscape saw significant developments, particularly in vulnerabilities and incidents affecting both AI technologies and critical infrastructure. A high-severity vulnerability in OpenClaw AI agents was addressed, preventing potential hijacking via WebSocket connections. Meanwhile, the German government is enhancing its cybersecurity capabilities against foreign hackers, reflecting a broader trend of increasing governmental powers in response to cyber threats. In the U.S., a major data breach at Canadian Tire compromised 38 million accounts, highlighting ongoing risks in data security. Additionally, the Pentagon's designation of Anthropic as a supply chain risk underscores the intersection of AI and national security. Lastly, the dormant Resurge malware was identified targeting Ivanti VPNs, indicating a sophisticated level of threat actor capabilities.",
