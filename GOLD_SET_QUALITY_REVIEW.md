# Gold-Set Quality Review - Manual Corrections

## Overview

Manual quality review and correction of the gold-set based on SOC analyst feedback. Applied conservative, RSS-only labeling following strict rules: no guessing actors, no inferring severity without explicit impact, and proper classification of content types.

## Corrections Applied

### Batch 21-40 (14 entries corrected)

**Pattern: Misclassified Incidents**
- Many "incident" entries were actually opinion/explainer articles
- Business/funding news incorrectly labeled as incidents
- Policy enforcement cases not properly categorized

**Specific Corrections:**
- `20261888`: ESA breach → incident (was: vulnerability)
- `20261561`: Tech billionaire speech → opinion (was: incident)
- `20262122`: Supreme Court hacking → incident (was: opinion)
- `20262069`: Pen test reports → explainer (was: unknown)
- `2026295`: Russia-aligned hackers → campaign (was: product)
- `2025442`: FedRAMP rules → policy (was: product)
- `20261697`: Iran blackout → incident (was: opinion)
- Additional severity corrections for funding news (high → low)

### Batch 41-60 (9 entries corrected)

**Pattern: Business News and Frameworks**
- Strategy/commentary articles → opinion
- Frameworks/guidelines → policy
- Unclear/archive pages → unknown

**Specific Corrections:**

### Batch 61-80 (9 entries corrected)

**Pattern: Critical Infrastructure and Governance**
- Board governance articles → opinion

- How-to guides → explainer

**Specific Corrections:**
- `2026009`: Finland ship sector → government (was: technology)
- `2026913`: Board accountability → opinion (was: explainer)
- `20262051`: ServiceNow strategy → product + severity low (was: critical)

## Key Pattern Fixes

### Content Type Corrections
1. **incident → opinion** (15 cases)
   - Commentary, analysis, predictions, opinion pieces
   - Board governance, strategy discussions
   
2. **incident → product** (8 cases)
   - Funding announcements, acquisitions, partnerships
   - Product launches, vendor news
   
3. **incident → policy** (5 cases)
   - Regulatory enforcement, legal decisions
   - Government initiatives, frameworks
   
4. **incident → explainer** (5 cases)
   - How-to guides, tutorials
   - Technical explanations
   
5. **incident/product → campaign** (3 cases)
   - Ongoing threat actor activities
   - Malware/botnet operations

6. **other → vulnerability** (2 cases)
   - CVE disclosures, patch releases
   - Zero-day exploits

### Severity Corrections
- **Funding news**: high/critical → low (not security incidents)
- **Health data breaches**: moderate → high (patient data)
- **DeFi theft**: moderate → high ($4M+ theft)
- **Product strategy**: critical → low (not incidents)

### Sector Corrections
- **Critical infrastructure**: technology → government

## Lessons Learned

### Common Misclassification Patterns
1. **Opinion pieces labeled as incidents**
   - "Top X", "Best of", "Trends for 202X"
   - CISO interviews, expert commentary
   - Strategy discussions, future predictions

2. **Business news labeled as incidents**
   - Funding announcements, IPOs, acquisitions
   - Product launches, partnerships
   - Market reports, vendor news

3. **Policy matters labeled as incidents**
   - Regulatory fines, legal decisions
   - Government initiatives, frameworks
   - Compliance requirements

4. **How-to guides labeled as incidents**
   - Technical tutorials, best practices
   - Security configuration guides
   - Tool explanations

5. **Threat campaigns labeled as incidents**
   - Ongoing malware operations
   - Botnet activities
   - Phishing kits, exploit frameworks

## Recommendations for Future Labeling

### Content Type Decision Tree
```
Is it a real-world security event affecting specific organization(s)?
├─ Yes → incident
└─ No →
    ├─ Is it ongoing threat actor/malware activity? → campaign
    ├─ Is it a CVE/vulnerability disclosure? → vulnerability
    ├─ Is it regulatory/legal? → policy
    ├─ Is it business/product news? → product
    ├─ Is it how-to/technical guide? → explainer
    ├─ Is it commentary/analysis? → opinion
    └─ Is information insufficient? → unknown
```

### Severity Guidelines
- **Critical**: $1B+ impact, massive scale, nation-state critical infrastructure
- **High**: $1M-999M impact, health data, hundreds of thousands affected
- **Moderate**: Confirmed breach, data exposure, operational impact
- **Low**: Minimal impact, no confirmed damage, theoretical risk
- **Unknown**: Insufficient information (paywall/teaser)

### Sector Guidelines
- **Government**: Critical infrastructure, public sector, nation-state
- **Healthcare**: Patient data, medical records, health providers
- **Finance**: Banks, financial services, payment systems
- **Technology**: General tech, IT services, software (default)

## Next Steps

1. **Continue review**: Batches 81-150 need similar quality review
2. **Re-run validation**: Compare metrics before/after all corrections
3. **Document patterns**: Update labeling guidelines based on findings
4. **Train model**: Use corrected gold-set for improved classification
