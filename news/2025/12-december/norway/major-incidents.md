## Conclusion

December 2025 found Norway in a period of heightened cyber vigilance following the year's dam sabotage and formal attribution to Russian actors. While no new major public incidents occurred in December specifically, the month represented continued implementation of enhanced security measures, particularly around critical infrastructure. The Digital Security Act's entry into force in October continued to shape the maritime and offshore sectors' approach to cybersecurity.

Norway's experience in 2025—particularly the Bremanger dam attack—provided stark evidence of cyber threats' potential for physical consequences and the reality of hybrid warfare targeting civilian infrastructure. The nation's response, combining enhanced technical defenses, regulatory frameworks, international cooperation, and public attribution of adversaries, offers a model for other small, democratic nations facing sophisticated state-sponsored threats.

Success in 2026 will require sustained focus on critical infrastructure protection, full implementation of the Digital Security Act, continued international cooperation with Nordic and NATO partners, and organizational resilience in the face of a persistent and capable adversary.
