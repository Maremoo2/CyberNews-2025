# December 2025 - United States Summary

## Overview

December 2025 marked a pivotal month for U.S. cybersecurity, characterized by major law enforcement victories against cybercriminal infrastructure, devastating data breaches affecting millions of Americans, and alarming statistics on the scope of fraud and scams targeting consumers. The month saw the FBI confiscate approximately $15 billion in illicit cryptocurrency from the Prince Group network—one of the largest financial seizures in cybercrime history—while the DOJ coordinated with international partners to dismantle the E-Note cryptocurrency exchange used extensively by ransomware gangs.

On the defensive side, the University of Phoenix disclosed a massive breach affecting 3.5 million individuals, Marquis Software Solutions revealed a fintech supply chain compromise exposing 780,000 banking customers' data, and the Tren de Aragua gang faced federal indictment for ATM jackpotting operations across multiple states. The year-end data painted a sobering picture: Americans lost $64.8 billion to cyber scams in 2025, with 70% of adults targeted, while ransomware incidents affected 24% of surveyed organizations—up from 16% in 2024.

## Conclusion

December 2025 encapsulated the dual nature of U.S. cybersecurity: significant law enforcement successes against cybercriminal infrastructure alongside devastating breaches affecting millions of Americans and staggering financial losses to scams and fraud. The FBI's $15 billion cryptocurrency seizure and the E-Note takedown demonstrated the growing capability to disrupt cybercriminal economics, yet the $64.8 billion lost to scams showed the scale of the challenge remains immense.

The 50% year-over-year increase in ransomware incidents (from 16% to 24% of organizations) reversed years of declining trends, indicating that attackers have adapted to improved defenses. The emergence of AI as both an attack vector (89% of phishing using AI) and a defensive tool marked an inflection point in the cyber arms race. The University of Phoenix and Marquis breaches demonstrated that even with advance zero-day exploitation and supply chain attacks remain devastatingly effective.

Success in 2026 will require:
- **Individual Americans**: Heightened awareness of AI-generated scams, multi-factor authentication adoption, skepticism of unsolicited communications
- **Organizations**: Implementation of CISA CPG 2.0, AI-powered defenses, robust incident response, supply chain security
- **Government**: Continued law enforcement pressure on cybercriminals, enhanced critical infrastructure protection, potential privacy legislation
- **Industry**: Information sharing, adoption of security standards, workforce development, responsible AI deployment

The United States possesses significant cybersecurity capabilities, resources, and expertise, but the threat landscape's evolution demands continuous adaptation, investment, and vigilance from all stakeholders.
