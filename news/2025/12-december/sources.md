## Verification and Credibility

All sources cited in the December 2025 cybersecurity news reports meet the following criteria:

**Authoritative Sources:**
- Government agencies (INTERPOL, NSM, U.S. government, EC, European Parliament)
- Data protection authorities (Datatilsynet)
- Established news organizations (Reuters, Aftenposten)
- Specialized cybersecurity publications (Dark Reading, CSO Online, BleepingComputer)
- Threat intelligence firms (Check Point, Cyble, F-Secure, AWS Security)
- Standards organizations (NIST)

**Verification Standards:**
- Primary sources used wherever possible
- Multiple source corroboration for major incidents
- Direct quotes and specific data points included
- Dates and technical details verified
- Attribution clearly stated

**Transparency:**
- All sources explicitly cited in incident reports
- URLs provided for reference
- Uncertainty noted where information is incomplete
- "Unknown" attribution when threat actors unidentified

## Additional Context

### Why These Sources?

**INTERPOL.int** provides authoritative information on international law enforcement operations and coordination across multiple countries.

**Check Point Research** offers comprehensive monthly threat intelligence reports covering multiple major incidents and vulnerabilities with technical detail.

**Government sources** (Whitehouse.gov, NIST.gov, Digital-Strategy.ec.europa.eu, Europarl.europa.eu, Datatilsynet.no) provide authoritative information on policy, regulations, and official responses.

**Specialized threat intelligence** (AWS Security, Cyble, F-Secure) offers deep technical analysis of specific attack campaigns, vulnerabilities, and emerging threats.

**Mainstream news** (Reuters, Aftenposten) provides verified reporting with editorial oversight and broader context.

**Cybersecurity media** (Dark Reading, CSO Online, BleepingComputer) offers technical depth and industry perspective on incidents and trends.

### Source Limitations

**Delayed Reporting:** Some incidents are reported weeks or months after occurrence (e.g., NGate malware from November 6 reported in December, Visma breach from 2021-2022 discovered July 2025).

**Incomplete Information:** Many incidents lack complete attribution or technical details due to ongoing investigations or organizational disclosure practices.

**Geographic Bias:** English-language sources may underrepresent incidents in non-English-speaking countries.

**Commercial Sources:** Some threat intelligence comes from commercial vendors who may have incentives to emphasize certain threats.

Despite these limitations, the combination of government, law enforcement, academic, news, and specialized sources provides a robust and balanced view of December 2025's cybersecurity landscape.
