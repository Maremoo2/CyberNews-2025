### Dec 2024 (Announced Dec 2025) – Køge Waterworks (Denmark)

- **Date:** December 2024 (attack occurred), December 2025 (public attribution announced)
- **Target:** Køge Waterworks (Danish municipal water plant)
- **Attack Type:** Cyber sabotage via Industrial Control System (ICS) manipulation
- **Impact:** Three burst pipes, water cut to approximately 450 homes
- **Attribution:** Russia-linked Z-Pentest group (attributed by Danish Defence Intelligence Service)

#### Incident Details

**Attack Methodology:**
- Attackers gained remote access to water plant control systems
- Direct manipulation of Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- Changed pressure settings in water pumps
- Caused physical damage to infrastructure
- No advanced malware or zero-day exploits required
- Demonstrates simplicity yet effectiveness of ICS attacks

**Physical Consequences:**
- Three water pipes burst due to pressure manipulation
- Approximately 450 homes lost water service
- Municipal water supply disrupted
- Required physical repairs to damaged infrastructure
- Emergency response activated

**Attribution and Geopolitical Context:**
- Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) announced attribution December 2025
- Formally attributed to Russia-linked Z-Pentest group
- DDIS Chief Beate Gangås made public confirmation
- Russian Embassy denied accusations, calling them "unfounded and politically motivated"
- Part of broader pattern of Russian cyber operations targeting European infrastructure

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- State-linked cyber actor infiltrated critical infrastructure
- Attackers manipulated physical equipment remotely undetected initially
- Attack demonstrates capabilities without sophisticated tools
- Hybrid warfare tactic targeting civilian infrastructure
- Calculated to cause disruption and demonstrate capability

**Regional Implications:**
- Part of broader Russian cyber aggression campaign in Europe
- Similar attacks reported against other Nordic infrastructure
- Norway previously attributed dam attack to Russian actors
- Pattern of targeting water and energy infrastructure
- NATO allies increasingly concerned about critical infrastructure protection

**Security Lessons:**
- Industrial Control Systems vulnerable even without zero-days
- Remote access to ICS requires enhanced security
- Physical consequences of cyber attacks on utilities
- Need for monitoring and anomaly detection in ICS environments
- Importance of network segmentation for critical systems
