# Cybersecurity Incidents – October 2025

## Global Overview

### Turbulence in October 2025

October 2025 was marked by a high level of cyberattacks globally. During the month, at least 20 major data breaches were publicly reported worldwide, with a minimum of 21.2 million sensitive records compromised. Among the five largest incidents globally were a data breach at the American lending platform Prosper Marketplace (17.6 million users affected) and at Indian e-commerce platform Dukaan (up to 16 million customer data exposed). Allianz Life (USA) and Canadian airline WestJet also reported breaches affecting approximately 1.5 million and 1.2 million individuals, respectively. These incidents illustrate the enormous scope of cyber threats across sectors globally.

### Trends and Tactics

Several overarching trends characterized the threat landscape in October:

- **Third-party vulnerabilities** were a leading cause of breaches – for example, through compromised cloud platforms and vendor systems
- **Ransomware** continued to dominate many attacks (involved in an estimated 44% of breaches globally in 2025), often combined with data theft for extortion
- A report from Check Point Research showed a **48% increase** in reported extortion attacks globally in October compared to the previous year, with new groups like Qilin, Akira, and Sinobi among the most active
- **Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day exploitation** was used to extort organizations, affecting entities including Harvard University and American Airlines (via subsidiary Envoy Air) in a campaign credited to the Cl0p ransomware group

### October 15, 2025 – F5 Networks Cyberattack (BIG-IP Source Code Theft)

- **Attack Type:** Nation-state breach targeting security vendor
- **Impact:** BIG-IP source code stolen; undisclosed vulnerabilities exposed; emergency CISA directive issued
- **Attribution:** Sophisticated nation-state actor (Chinese threat actor UNC5221)
- **Details:** F5 Networks announced that a sophisticated nation-state actor breached its internal systems, stealing portions of the proprietary BIG-IP source code and details of undisclosed vulnerabilities. The attacker maintained long-term access to F5's networks, and U.S. CISA issued an emergency directive warning of urgent patching for F5 products. The theft of source code and vulnerability data meant that attackers could develop new exploits against hundreds of thousands of enterprise networks using F5 devices. This vendor supply-chain breach had far-reaching implications for network security worldwide.

### State Actors and Vulnerabilities

State-sponsored hacking groups also intensified their activity:

- **China-affiliated APT groups** exploited a "ToolShell" zero-day in Microsoft SharePoint, compromising organizations on four continents (including US energy and health authorities)
- Another Chinese threat actor, tracked as **UNC5221**, breached American IT provider F5 and stole portions of the BIG-IP product's source code as well as unknown vulnerabilities. This attack was serious enough to trigger emergency alerts from authorities to patch critical systems
- The popular **Discord platform** was indirectly hit: an attack against a third-party support vendor exposed large amounts of user information (including ~70,000 scanned ID documents) for Discord users globally

These incidents demonstrate how both nation-state hackers and cybercriminals exploit unknown vulnerabilities and supply chains to target even well-protected objectives.

### Global Risk Picture

Overall, October 2025 underscored the persistent high pressure of cyber threats internationally. Many organizations reported breaches without clear evidence of data theft, which may indicate better detection – but also more cautious statements during incidents. Attack frequency remained high: estimates suggest a cyberattack occurs globally every 39 seconds on average. The largest losses occurred in finance and health sectors, where individual incidents on average cost millions of dollars.

October's global wave of attacks – from massive data leaks to targeted APT operations – illustrates that cyber resilience is critical in all regions and sectors.
