# October 2025 - EU Major Incidents

## Major Data Breaches

### October 14, 2025 – Volkswagen Group France – Qilin Ransomware

- **Date:** October 14, 2025
- **Target:** Volkswagen Group France (French subsidiary of Volkswagen)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware
- **Attribution:** Qilin ransomware group
- **Impact:** Approximately 150 GB of sensitive data stolen, including:
  - Personal information about vehicle owners
  - Detailed vehicle information
  - Internal documents
- **Details:** The French subsidiary of Volkswagen was hit by Qilin ransomware. The attackers claimed to have stolen around 150 GB of sensitive data including personal information about car owners, detailed vehicle information, and internal documents. As proof, the hackers published a bundle of documents online. This incident illustrates how even large industrial companies in the EU are targeted by professional ransomware attacks with significant data leakage.

### October 15, 2025 – Mango (Spain) – Third-Party Marketing Vendor Breach

- **Date:** October 15, 2025
- **Target:** Mango (international fashion chain, Spain)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach via third-party service provider
- **Attribution:** Unknown (external marketing service provider compromised)
- **Impact:** Exposure of Mango customer contact information:
  - Names
  - Email addresses
  - Phone numbers
  - Postal codes
  - Countries
- **Details:** The international fashion chain Mango experienced a data breach via an external marketing service provider. The breach at the third party exposed Mango customers' contact information (names, email, phone numbers, postal codes, and countries). It was reported that no payment data or passwords were compromised. This case highlights the vulnerability in the supply chain – even though core data systems were intact, a third-party breach led to a significant privacy violation.

### October 16, 2025 – Verisure (Sweden) – Data Breach Post-IPO

- **Date:** October 16, 2025
- **Target:** Verisure (alarm company, Sweden)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach

- **Impact:** 
  - Leakage of sensitive customer and employee data
  - Reputational damage during critical IPO period
- **Details:** Alarm company Verisure reported that a newly acquired Swedish entity was subjected to a data breach just one week after the company's stock market debut. Unauthorized access led to leakage of sensitive customer and employee data. Verisure confirmed the incident and cooperated with authorities on follow-up. That this occurred right after the IPO underscored the risk of damage to reputation and trust for a newly launched company.

### October 26, 2025 – Svenska kraftnät (Sweden) – Critical Infrastructure Attack

- **Date:** October 26, 2025
- **Target:** Svenska kraftnät (Swedish power grid operator)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware with data theft
- **Attribution:** Everest ransomware group
- **Impact:** 
  - Approximately 280 GB of internal data stolen
  - Administrative data compromised (not operational technology systems)
  - Attack on critical infrastructure
- **Details:** Sweden's power grid operator, Svenska kraftnät, confirmed a data breach around October 26. The attack targeted an external file transfer service, and the Everest ransomware group took responsibility, claiming to have stolen around 280 GB of internal data. Svenska kraftnät stated that only administrative data, and not the actual operational control systems (OT), were affected. This critical infrastructure attack demonstrates that even support systems around core operations must be secured to avoid potentially serious consequences.

## Notable Cyberattacks on EU Organizations

### October 24, 2025 – European Defense Companies – North Korean Espionage

- **Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Target:** At least three European companies:
  - Metal works facility in Southeast Europe
  - Aviation component manufacturer in Central Europe
  - Defense enterprise
- **Attack Type:** Cyber espionage via social engineering
- **Attribution:** Lazarus Group (North Korea)
- **Impact:** 
  - Theft of confidential technology and know-how related to drones (UAV)
  - Intellectual property theft
- **Details:** EU countries experienced targeted espionage operations. At least three European companies – a metal works in Southeast Europe, an aviation component manufacturer in Central Europe, and a defense enterprise – were infiltrated by the North Korean Lazarus group via fake job offers sent by email. The attackers used a malware tool called "ScoringMathTea" (RAT) to steal confidential technology and know-how related to drones (UAVs). This operation, which resulted in theft of unmanned aircraft technology, shows how state hacking groups from outside (here North Korea) actively target European high-technology to steal intellectual property.

### October 2025 – UK Foreign Office Systems Breach

- **Date:** October 2025
- **Target:** British Foreign Office (while UK is no longer in EU, affects European security)
- **Attack Type:** System breach and data theft
- **Attribution:** Storm 1849 (suspected Chinese cyber group)
- **Impact:** 
  - Possible theft of tens of thousands of visa details
  - Compromise of government systems
- **Details:** Although the United Kingdom is no longer in the EU, events affect European security. In October, it emerged that hackers linked to China (called "Storm 1849") likely broke into British Foreign Office systems and may have stolen tens of thousands of visa details. British authorities confirmed that such an attack took place in October, although direct attribution to China was not formally confirmed. This incident underscores an elevated threat level in Europe, where geopolitical tensions translate into cyberattacks against critical infrastructure and government targets.

### October 2025 – Pro-Russian Attacks on European Infrastructure

- **Date:** October 2025
- **Target:** Various European targets including:
  - Swedish power grid (Svenska kraftnät)

In neighboring Sweden, the power grid operator was compromised (Everest attack), and in Denmark, public services were disrupted in attacks that authorities link to Russia. These incidents underscore an elevated threat level in Europe, where geopolitical tensions translate into cyberattacks against critical infrastructure and state targets.

### Red Hat Consulting Data Theft

- **Date:** October 1, 2025
- **Target:** Red Hat Consulting (owned by IBM, operates globally including EU)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach and source code theft

This attack on Red Hat occurred on October 1 and also affected European clients. Overall, such incidents show that both public and private actors in the EU were challenged by advanced threats throughout October.

## New Legislation and Regulation in EU

### NIS2 Directive Implementation

The EU adopted the updated NIS2 directive for network and information security in 2022. By October 2025, many member countries still struggled to implement the directive into national law, despite the October 2024 deadline. NIS2 expands the scope from the previous NIS and introduces stricter requirements for operational resilience, incident reporting, and supervision for a range of sectors.

Among other things, more "important services" such as digital marketplaces, waste management, and postal and distribution services must now also follow security requirements. As of October, several countries had only published draft laws or consultations, and several countries (including Norway) lagged behind in introducing the necessary legislative changes. The work on NIS2 marks a significant escalation of the EU's common cyber regulations.

### Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Progress

The EU's Cyber Resilience Act entered into force in December 2024 and will from 2027 require built-in security for virtually all products with digital elements. In October 2025, the EU Commission actively worked to elaborate the regulations – including drafting a delegated act (draft as of October 30, 2025) to clarify rules about vulnerability reporting under CRA.

This proposed regulation would specify exceptions where national CSIRTs can temporarily delay sharing information about critical vulnerabilities, for example if a patch is imminent or the information is highly sensitive. In addition, standardization bodies such as ETSI published draft European standards to support product requirements (e.g., for password management and OS security).

The EU's work on CRA in October signals an early focus on making manufacturers accountable for "security by design," with potential fines up to EUR 15 million for non-compliance.
