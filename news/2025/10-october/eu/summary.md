# October 2025 - European Union Summary

## Overview

October 2025 witnessed significant cybersecurity challenges across the European Union, with major data breaches affecting organizations in multiple member states. The month highlighted the persistent threat from ransomware groups, supply chain vulnerabilities, and state-sponsored actors targeting EU infrastructure and businesses.

Key incidents included attacks on major industrial companies (Volkswagen France), retail chains (Mango Spain), security services (Verisure Sweden), and critical infrastructure (Svenska kraftnät). These breaches collectively exposed millions of European citizens' personal data and demonstrated the broad spectrum of targets – from consumer-facing businesses to essential services.

## Key Trends

### Ransomware Dominance

Professional ransomware groups like Qilin and Everest continued their aggressive campaigns against EU targets. The Volkswagen Group France incident, attributed to Qilin, involved the theft of approximately 150 GB of sensitive data including customer information and internal documents. Svenska kraftnät's breach by the Everest group compromised around 280 GB of internal data, marking a serious attack on critical energy infrastructure.

### Third-Party and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

The Mango breach demonstrated how third-party service providers can become vectors for large-scale data exposure. In this case, an external marketing service provider's compromise led to the exposure of Mango customer contact information across multiple countries. This pattern of supply chain attacks underscores the need for comprehensive vendor security assessments throughout the EU.

### Targeting of Critical Infrastructure

The attack on Svenska kraftnät, Sweden's power grid operator, represented a significant escalation in threats to EU critical infrastructure. While the attackers only accessed administrative data and not operational technology (OT) systems, the incident highlighted vulnerabilities in support systems surrounding core infrastructure operations.

### State-Sponsored Activity

Pro-Russian cyber actors maintained their presence in Europe, with attacks linked to geopolitical tensions. The Swedish power grid incident and Danish public service disruptions were among several events attributed to Russia-aligned threat actors. European defense companies were also targeted by the North Korean Lazarus group using sophisticated social engineering techniques.

## Legislative Developments

### NIS2 Directive Implementation Challenges

Many EU member states continued to struggle with implementing the updated NIS2 directive into national law, despite the October 2024 deadline having passed. NIS2 significantly expands the scope from the previous NIS directive and introduces stricter requirements for operational resilience, incident reporting, and supervision across numerous sectors.

The directive now includes "important services" such as digital marketplaces, waste management, and postal/distribution services under security requirements. Several countries had only published draft laws or consultations by October, with implementation timelines varying significantly across the Union.

### Cyber Resilience Act Progress

The EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), which entered into force in December 2024, will require built-in security for nearly all products with digital elements starting in 2027. In October 2025, the EU Commission actively worked to elaborate on the regulations – including drafting a delegated act (draft as of October 30, 2025) to clarify rules about vulnerability reporting under CRA.

The proposed regulation would specify exceptions where national CSIRTs can temporarily delay sharing information about critical vulnerabilities, such as when a patch is imminent or the information is highly sensitive. Additionally, standardization bodies like ETSI published draft European standards to support product requirements (e.g., for password management and OS security).

The EU's work on CRA in October signals an early focus on making manufacturers accountable for "security by design," with potential fines up to EUR 15 million for non-compliance.

## Regional Security Posture

Europe faced heightened threats from multiple directions in October:

- **East:** Continued Russian-linked cyber operations targeting both infrastructure and democratic processes
- **Northeast:** North Korean APT groups conducting industrial espionage against European defense manufacturers
- **Internal:** Criminal ransomware groups increasingly sophisticated in their operations
- **Asia:** Chinese state-sponsored groups conducting espionage operations that affected European targets

The combination of geopolitical tensions, organized cybercrime, and ongoing challenges with legislative implementation created a complex security environment requiring coordinated responses at both national and EU levels.

## Impact Assessment

- Multiple major corporations compromised with significant data exposure
- Critical infrastructure targeted (energy sector)
- Millions of EU citizens' personal data exposed across various breaches
- Legislative implementation delays potentially leaving security gaps
- Increased awareness of supply chain risks
- Growing recognition of cybersecurity as a strategic priority at EU level

## Looking Ahead

The incidents of October 2025 reinforced the urgency of completing NIS2 implementation and preparing for CRA compliance. Organizations across the EU must strengthen their resilience against ransomware, improve third-party risk management, and enhance protection of critical infrastructure. The EU's comprehensive legislative framework, once fully implemented, will significantly raise the baseline security requirements across member states – but the transition period presents ongoing challenges and vulnerabilities.
