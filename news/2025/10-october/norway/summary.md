# October 2025 - Norway Summary

## Overview

Norway experienced a heightened cyber threat level in October 2025, with Norwegian businesses facing an unprecedented volume of cyberattacks. According to Check Point Research, Norwegian companies were subjected to an average of 2,123 cyberattacks per week in October – nearly 10% more than in September and a full 28% increase compared to October 2024. This placed Norway as the most attacked country among Nordic nations, significantly ahead of neighboring countries.

The threat landscape was dominated by pro-Russian cyber actors demonstrating capabilities against Norwegian critical infrastructure, though the month was also marked by significant legislative developments with the Digital Security Act entering into force.

## Key Trends

### Pro-Russian Threat Actors

The threat from Russia-affiliated actors was particularly emphasized in 2025. Background context from April demonstrated capabilities:

**April 2025 – Bremanger Dam Incident (Context):**
In April, a pro-Russian hacker group seized control of the Bremanger hydroelectric dam in Vestland, opening floodgates and allowing water to flow uncontrolled for four hours. In August, PST (Norwegian Police Security Service) officially confirmed for the first time that Russia was behind this incident as part of a hybrid warfare strategy.

PST Chief Beate Gangås stated: "Our Russian neighbor has become more dangerous" and explained that the purpose of this type of operation is to influence and create fear and chaos among the general population. The dam episode, while occurring before October, set a backdrop leading to increased monitoring of Norwegian water and power infrastructure.

In October, Norwegian authorities reported several averted attempts at intrusion into water and power sectors (which NSM had warned about already in May). Russian hacktivist groups continued with denial-of-service attacks against Norwegian websites in protest of Norway's support for Ukraine, though with limited effect.

### No Major Internal Data Leaks

Norway did not see any single mega-data breaches publicly disclosed in October. In contrast to neighboring countries like Sweden (Svenska kraftnät incident) and Finland (where psychotherapy clinic Vastaamo was hacked the previous year), it was relatively quiet regarding confirmed new leaks of Norwegians' personal data this month.

Smaller incidents occurred – some Norwegian SMEs were hit by ransomware (e.g., NSM reports that a couple of industrial companies had files encrypted but did not pay ransom). Norwegian municipalities experienced several phishing waves in October, and some had to temporarily close email systems. These incidents had limited damage scope and are part of the general threat picture.

### Norwegian Defense and Espionage

Intelligence-wise, the Norwegian Defense Intelligence Service (E-tjenesten) reported that attempts at digital espionage against Norway remain persistently high. In October, it became known that Norway participates in a new Nordic-Baltic cyber consortium together with six other countries for better joint analysis and detection of attacks.

Following several incidents of hacker activity against defense-related targets, attempts at phishing against Norwegian defense personnel were uncovered in late October that bore similarities to a known Russian campaign. Although no serious defense breaches were publicly confirmed in October, Norway maintains high preparedness – especially since PST also warned that Chinese intelligence is active in recruiting sources in Norway.

## International Incidents Affecting Norway

### Third-Party Breaches with Norwegian Impact

Norwegian businesses and citizens were indirectly affected by international incidents:

**Discord Data Leak:**
The Discord breach of a third-party support vendor exposed ~70,000 ID documents globally, which likely included many EU/EEA citizens including Norwegians.

**Mango Data Breach:**
Mango's customer data breach in Spain likely included information about Norwegian online customers of the clothing chain, since Mango operates in Norway.

**Software Supply Chain:**
Many Norwegian businesses use American IT vendors. The Red Hat breach and F5 incident triggered concern domestically, since compromised source code or zero-days can be exploited against Norwegian systems. NSM sent out "vulnerability alerts" to Norwegian businesses in October recommending immediate patching of Oracle, F5, and Adobe Commerce.

### Consumer-Level Crime

At the consumer level, NorSIS and police registered an increase in fraud attempts during the month. Among other things, mass SMS messages were sent out posing as the Norwegian Postal Service (Posten) and Customs (Tollvesenet), with links that planted malware for bank account theft. ID-porten also reported increased scanning for vulnerabilities, but without breaches.

Overall, Norwegian businesses and citizens must remain continuously vigilant, even though Norway avoided the very worst individual attacks in October.

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Digital Security Act Enters Force – October 1, 2025

October 1, 2025, marked a watershed moment when the **Digital Security Act (Digitalsikkerhetsloven)** entered into force in Norway. This law, Norway's implementation of the EU's NIS directive, imposes basic requirements for digital security on businesses providing critical and important services.

**Key Provisions:**
- **Scope:** Covers 28 sectors and services including:
  - Energy
  - Transport
  - Health
  - Water supply
  - Digital services (cloud services, online marketplaces)
- **Management Responsibility:** Company leadership has clear responsibility for IT security, including:
  - Risk assessments
  - Preventive measures
  - Duty to notify authorities of serious incidents
- **No Transition Period:** Requirements apply in full from October 1
- **Penalties:** Violations can result in fines up to 4% of revenue (max 50 million NOK)
- **Guidance:** National Security Authority (NSM) offers guidance to businesses on the law and regulations

This legislative shift is perhaps the most important domestic cybersecurity measure in several years, intended to significantly elevate the security level in Norwegian critical infrastructure and business sectors.

### National Security Month 2025

October was also **National Security Month (Nasjonal Sikkerhetsmåned)**, an annual awareness campaign organized by NorSIS and government authorities. The 2025 theme was **ransomware and social engineering**.

**Campaign Activities:**
- Webinars throughout the month
- Distribution of information materials
- Exercises in businesses to increase employee awareness around phishing and security culture
- Campaign targeting schools teaching youth about passwords and fraud calls

National Security Month 2025 came at an opportune time given the global wave of ransomware. NorSIS reported increased engagement from Norwegian businesses as a result of the campaign. Authorities view this as an important soft strategy for building a security culture in society parallel to technical and legislative measures.

### Øvelse Digital 2025 (Preparation)

In late November (immediately after October), Norway conducted the largest national cyber exercise in many years, **Øvelse Digital**. Preparations were ongoing in October, with scenarios including attacks on power supply and telecommunications.

The exercise involved over 250 businesses across public and private sectors and aimed to strengthen society's ability to withstand comprehensive digital attacks. Learning points from the exercise will inform preparedness plans going forward.

**Other October Initiatives:**
- Government announced increased allocations to NSM and police cyber crime units in the 2026 state budget
- Support for a new national cybersecurity center in Trondheim
- Participation in Nordic-Baltic cyber consortium with six other countries

### The Sum of Initiatives

The combination of these measures – legislation, awareness-raising, and exercises – demonstrates a comprehensive national approach to cybersecurity, in recognition that the threat against Norway is persistent and complex.

## Impact Assessment

- **2,123 weekly attacks** per company on average
- **28% increase** year-over-year attack volume
- **Most targeted Nordic country** by attack frequency
- **Zero major data breaches** publicly disclosed domestically
- **Multiple phishing campaigns** affecting municipalities
- **Several SME ransomware incidents** (no ransom paid)
- **New comprehensive legislation** enacted
- **250+ organizations** preparing for national cyber exercise

## Looking Ahead

October 2025 reinforced that Norway faces a sophisticated and persistent cyber threat from multiple directions:
- **State actors** (primarily Russia, also Chinese intelligence interest)
- **Ransomware groups** targeting businesses
- **Consumer fraud** operations
- **Supply chain vulnerabilities** through international vendors

The enactment of the Digital Security Act represents Norway's most significant cybersecurity legislative development, establishing clear responsibilities and penalties while raising baseline security requirements across critical sectors. Combined with awareness campaigns and practical exercises, Norway is taking a multi-layered approach to building national cyber resilience.

The heightened attack frequency – 28% year-over-year increase – demonstrates that threat actors view Norway as a valuable target, necessitating continued vigilance and investment in both defensive capabilities and incident response preparedness.
