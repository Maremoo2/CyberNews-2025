## Pro-Russian Cyber Threats

### April 2025 – Bremanger Dam Cyber Sabotage (Background Context)

- **Date:** April 2025 (official attribution August 2025)
- **Target:** Bremanger hydroelectric dam, Vestland, Norway
- **Attack Type:** Cyber sabotage / SCADA system compromise
- **Attribution:** Pro-Russian hacker group (officially confirmed by PST in August)
- **Impact:** 
  - Floodgates opened remotely
  - Uncontrolled water flow for four hours
  - Demonstration of capability to compromise Norwegian critical infrastructure
- **Details:** Already in April, a pro-Russian hacker group seized control of the Bremanger power plant's dam in Vestland – they opened floodgates and let water stream out uncontrolled for four hours. The purpose seemed to be to demonstrate Russia's ability to hit Norwegian infrastructure without causing maximum damage. 

  In August, PST officially confirmed for the first time that Russia was behind this incident as part of a hybrid warfare strategy. PST Chief Beate Gangås stated: "Our Russian neighbor has become more dangerous" and that they seek to create fear and uncertainty in the population.

  This dam episode – although it occurred before October – hung as a backdrop and led to increased monitoring of Norwegian hydropower and energy infrastructure.

- **Significance:** First confirmed Russian cyber sabotage of Norwegian critical infrastructure, demonstrating both capability and intent to target essential services.

## Summary Assessment

October 2025 demonstrated that Norway faces a multi-faceted cyber threat:

**Threat Actors:**
- State-sponsored (primarily Russian, also Chinese intelligence interest)
- Ransomware groups targeting businesses
- Consumer fraud operations
- Supply chain risks through international vendors

**National Response:**
- Landmark Digital Security Act implementation
- Comprehensive awareness campaign

- Increased budget allocations
- International cooperation strengthening

**Key Statistics:**
- 2,123 attacks per week per company (average)
