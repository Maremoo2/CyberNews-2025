### October 1, 2025 – Red Hat (IBM) – GitLab Source Code Breach

- **Date:** October 1, 2025
- **Target:** Red Hat Consulting (IBM subsidiary)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach and source code theft
- **Attribution:** Crimson Collective (initial claim), ShinyHunters (subsequent extortion)
- **Impact:** 
  - Approximately 570 GB of data exfiltrated

### October 15, 2025 – F5, Inc. – Chinese State-Sponsored Source Code Theft

- **Date:** October 15, 2025
- **Target:** F5, Inc. (network and security solutions provider)
- **Attack Type:** Advanced persistent threat (APT) / Source code and vulnerability theft
- **Attribution:** UNC5221 (Chinese state-sponsored group)
- **Impact:** 
  - Parts of F5's BIG-IP source code stolen
  - Internal data on undisclosed vulnerabilities compromised
  - At least three new CVEs related to the incident
- **Details:** F5 – a provider of network and security solutions – revealed that unauthorized parties had compromised the company's development environment for the BIG-IP platform. The hackers (linked to Chinese group UNC5221) stole parts of F5's source code as well as internal data on vulnerabilities not yet publicly known. Shortly after, US Cyber Command and CISA issued warnings, and a critical patch was developed for at least three new CVEs related to the incident. 

  This targeted attack on a security vendor attracted great attention – both because a nation-state actor was behind it, and because compromise of such a vendor can give attackers insight into weaknesses at thousands of F5's customers (including many government agencies and businesses). The case underscored the need for stricter vendor security measures.

The consequence was that around 70,000 copies of user IDs (government documents) and large amounts of chat logs, emails, IP addresses, etc. were stolen and leaked. No specific group was named, and Discord's own systems were not compromised, but the incident prompted American regulators to consider stricter requirements for subcontractor security for tech companies.

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### CISA Law Expiration and Renewal

#### October 1, 2025 – CISA Law Expires

- **Event:** Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 expires
- **Context:** Expired during budget crisis
- **Impact:** 
  - Threat to voluntary threat-sharing cooperation between private sector and government
  - Potential 80% drop in information sharing without legal protections
  - Incident reporting times increased from 30 minutes to 24 hours during lapse
- **Details:** An important pillar of US cyber defense, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA law), expired on October 1, 2025, during a budget crisis. The law has facilitated voluntary threat-sharing cooperation between private companies and government agencies by providing legal immunity for sharing cyber threat information. While the Department of Homeland Security assured that sharing platforms would be maintained temporarily, experts feared sharing could drop by up to 80% without the legal protections the law provides.

#### Late October 2025 – Congress Acts to Renew CISA

- **Event:** Temporary extension and new legislation introduced
- **Legislation:** 
  - Temporary extension to January 2026 passed
  - PAACT Act (Protecting America Against Cyber Threats Act) introduced – 10-year renewal
- **Support:** Bipartisan support with over 80 industry organizations backing renewal
- **Details:** Congress acted quickly: by the end of the month, a temporary extension was passed until January 2026, and new bipartisan legislation – the PAACT Act – was introduced to renew the threat-sharing law for 10 years. Senators warned that during the period the law was down, reporting time for incidents increased from 30 minutes to 24 hours, which they called unacceptable for national security. Re-authorization of the CISA law therefore became a major focus, with broad support from industry and government to ensure continuous information flow about cyber threats.

### National Cybersecurity Awareness Month

- **Event:** October 2025 National Cybersecurity Awareness Month
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Phishing prevention
  - Home network security
  - Business cybersecurity education
- **Policy Implementation:** Continued implementation of Biden Administration's National Cybersecurity Strategy 2023:
  - New guidelines for critical infrastructure strengthening
  - Digital supply chain security requirements
  - Zero Trust architecture requirements for federal agencies by end of FY2025
  - New public-private partnerships for cyber crisis response exercises
- **Details:** October is traditionally National Cybersecurity Awareness Month in the US, and 2025 was no exception. Government agencies ran awareness campaigns for both citizens and businesses with themes including phishing prevention and securing home networks. In parallel, implementation of the Biden Administration's National Cybersecurity Strategy 2023 continued, resulting in new guidelines for strengthening critical infrastructure and digital supply chains. Among other things, requirements were set that federal agencies and suppliers meet Zero Trust architecture principles by the end of FY2025. In October, several agencies reported progress in this area, and new public-private partnerships were announced for joint cyber crisis response exercises.

### CISA Emergency Directives and Initiatives

#### CIRCIA Pilot Program

- **Program:** Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) testing
- **Requirements:** Will require critical businesses to report serious incidents within 72 hours
- **Status:** Some sectors began voluntary reporting practice in October
