# October 2025 - Asia Summary

## Overview

The cyber threat landscape in Asia during October 2025 was characterized by heightened activity from both nation-state actors and ransomware groups. The region experienced significant supply chain attacks, particularly in South Korea, alongside continued industrial espionage targeting high-value intellectual property in Japan. India recorded massive volumes of cyberattacks, while geopolitical tensions manifested through increased state-sponsored hacking operations.

## Key Trends

### State-Sponsored Hacking Operations

Asian nation-state threat actors demonstrated advanced capabilities throughout October:

**Chinese APT Activity:**
- Chinese-affiliated groups exploited the "ToolShell" zero-day in Microsoft SharePoint, compromising organizations globally including in Asia
- The UNC5221 group (China-linked) breached US IT provider F5, stealing BIG-IP source code and vulnerabilities – demonstrating China's capacity for sophisticated operations with global impact
- Chinese authorities counter-accused the US NSA of using "special cyber weapons" against Chinese infrastructure, reflecting tense cyber-diplomatic climate

**North Korean Operations:**
- The Lazarus Group expanded operations, targeting European defense contractors but also operating regionally
- North Korean actors increasingly blended into ransomware operations for financial gain
- Microsoft tracked a North Korean subgroup ("Moonstone Sleet") collaborating with Qilin ransomware and developing custom ransomware (FakePenny) used against a Korean defense company

### Ransomware Surge in South Korea

South Korea experienced an explosive growth in ransomware victims in September-October, becoming the second-most affected country globally after the US. The country averaged about 2 victims per month between September 2024 and August 2025, but saw 25 cases in September 2025 alone.

The "Korean Leaks" campaign represented one of the most comprehensive attacks ever against South Korea, where the Qilin ransomware group exploited a compromised managed service provider (MSP) to infect at least 28 Korean companies, primarily in the financial sector. The campaign resulted in theft of over 2 terabytes of data (1+ million files).

Qilin emerged as one of the most active ransomware operations in 2025, exhibiting "explosive growth" in October by claiming over 180 victims globally, responsible for 29% of all ransomware attacks.

### Massive Attack Volume in India

India faced over 265 million cyberattacks in 2025 according to Seqrite's India Cyber Threat Report 2026. October continued this alarming trend with:
- Trojans and File Infectors accounting for 70% of all attacks
- Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Delhi as the most affected regions
- Mumbai, Kolkata, and New Delhi as top targeted cities
- Education, Healthcare, and Manufacturing accounting for nearly 47% of detections

Traditional malware such as trojans and file infectors dominated attack methods, with persistent phishing campaigns targeting citizens and businesses throughout the month.

### Japan Industrial Disruption

Japanese companies experienced both espionage and destructive attacks:
- Nintendo allegedly targeted by Crimson Collective, with claims of access to sensitive production files and developer documents
- Askul (major office supplier) hit by destructive malware that completely shut down e-commerce platform and logistics operations for several days

Japanese authorities warned of increasing supply chain attack risks affecting downstream customers.

## Regional Geopolitics and Cyber Warfare

### Convergence of State and Criminal Activity

A significant trend is the blurring line between state hacking operations and financially-motivated crime. North Korea's participation in ransomware attacks (via subgroups in Qilin campaigns) exemplifies how states use criminal activity for economic gain. This hybrid approach challenges traditional response frameworks, as investigations must consider both intelligence and financial motives.

### Middle East Spillover

While focused on the Middle East, the Iran-Israel cyber tensions had regional echoes. Over 35 pro-Iranian hacker groups coordinated attacks against Israeli targets in June, with activity continuing through autumn. Asia's cyber domain is heavily influenced by geopolitical factors, from Korean Peninsula dynamics to great power rivalry between China and the West.

### Critical Infrastructure Concerns

Following attacks like the Norwegian dam breach and Swedish power grid compromise, Japanese cybersecurity teams warned that power grids and transportation in Asia could be next. Many Asian countries are investing in OT system segmentation and attack simulations, though supply networks, healthcare, and public sectors remain relatively vulnerable in several parts of Asia.

## Major Regional Incidents

### South Korea – Korean Leaks Supply Chain Campaign

The sophisticated "Korean Leaks" campaign compromised a South Korean MSP as an entry point for ransomware attacks. Qilin exploited the MSP access to infect at least 28 Korean companies, primarily in finance, conducted in three waves resulting in theft of over 2 TB of data.

Attackers mixed criminal extortion with political rhetoric, accusing Korean institutions of corruption and threatening to release documents that could "destabilize financial markets." Evidence suggests potential North Korean involvement (Moonstone Sleet) alongside the Qilin Ransomware-as-a-Service network.

### India – Dukaan Platform Security Failure

Indian e-commerce platform Dukaan experienced a severe security flaw exposing over 3.5 million sellers and 16 million customers. Sensitive data was exposed for over two years through an unauthorized, unencrypted Apache Kafka data stream, including:
- Order data and customer details
- API keys and payment tokens for Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay
- Purchase history and contact information

The vulnerability could potentially have allowed theft of funds and highlighted the enormous consequences of a single configuration error.

### Japan – Nintendo and Askul Incidents

**Nintendo (October 13):** Crimson Collective claimed to have hacked Nintendo Co., allegedly obtaining access to sensitive production files, developer documents, and backups of internal systems. While Nintendo didn't publicly confirm details, the claim attracted significant attention.

**Askul (October 20):** Major Japanese office supplier Askul was hit by destructive malware that fully shut down the company's e-commerce platform and logistics operations for several days. The incident showed how paralyzed a business can become when core IT is compromised.

## Emerging Security Measures

### Regional Cooperation

- Singapore hosted regional cybersecurity exercise with ASEAN countries focused on coordinated response
- Japan accelerated Cyber Defense Command establishment
- Seven Nordic-Baltic countries formed cyber consortium for better cross-border threat analysis
- India launched new Digital Risk Protection services through state CERT-In

### Increased Defense Investment

Many Asian nations are:
- Investing in OT system segmentation
- Conducting attack simulation exercises
- Enhancing supply chain security requirements
- Improving ISP cooperation on DDoS filtering
- Strengthening incident response capabilities

## Impact Assessment

- **28 Korean companies** compromised in coordinated campaign
- **2+ terabytes** of data stolen in Korean Leaks
- **265 million+ cyberattacks** against Indian systems in 2025
- **16 million customers** exposed in Dukaan breach
- **180+ victims** claimed by Qilin in October alone
- **70% of attacks** in India from Trojans and File Infectors
- **29%** of global ransomware attacks attributed to Qilin

## Looking Ahead

Asia faces a complex threat landscape where traditional boundaries between state espionage, criminal activity, and destructive attacks are increasingly blurred. The massive volume of attacks in India, sophisticated supply chain compromises in South Korea, and industrial espionage in Japan demonstrate that threats are both high-volume and highly targeted.

Regional cooperation initiatives show recognition of the transnational nature of cyber threats, but significant gaps remain in securing critical infrastructure and supply chains across many Asian nations. The convergence of geopolitical tensions with cybercriminal opportunism creates a particularly challenging environment requiring coordinated defense strategies and enhanced resilience measures.
