# October 2025 - Asia Major Incidents

## Japan

### October 13, 2025 – Nintendo Corp – Alleged Hack

- **Date:** October 13, 2025
- **Target:** Nintendo Co. (Japanese gaming giant)
- **Attack Type:** Alleged corporate espionage / data breach
- **Attribution:** Crimson Collective (claimed responsibility)
- **Impact:** Claimed access to:

- **Details:** Video game giant Nintendo Co. was allegedly hacked by the Crimson Collective group. The hackers claimed to have obtained access to sensitive production files, developer documents, and backups of Nintendo's internal systems. Nintendo did not publicly confirm the details, but the claim attracted great attention in Japan's business community. The attack, if genuine, suggests industrial espionage against Japan's technology sector, and came shortly after the same hacker group also went after Red Hat globally. Japanese companies increased monitoring of their networks afterward to detect any breaches.

## South Korea

### September-October 2025 – "Korean Leaks" Supply Chain Ransomware Campaign

- **Date:** September-October 2025 (three waves)
- **Target:** 28+ South Korean companies via compromised managed service provider (MSP)
- **Attack Type:** Supply chain attack / Ransomware campaign
- **Attribution:** Qilin ransomware group (with potential North Korean involvement via Moonstone Sleet)
- **Impact:** 
  - 28 confirmed victims (primarily financial sector)
  - Over 2 terabytes of data stolen (1+ million files)
  - Data published on leak sites
  - Threats to release information that could destabilize financial markets
- **Details:** In a sophisticated supply chain campaign, a South Korean IT service provider (MSP) was compromised as an entry point for ransomware attacks. The Qilin ransomware group exploited the MSP access to infect at least 28 different Korean companies, predominantly in the financial sector. 

  The campaign, called "Korean Leaks," was conducted in three waves and resulted in the theft of over 2 terabytes of data (1+ million files) that were published on a leak site. The hackers accused Korean institutions of corruption and threatened to publish documents that allegedly could destabilize the financial market.

  Interestingly, the rhetoric was mixed with political messages, suggesting North Korean actors (Moonstone Sleet) may have been involved together with the Qilin Ransomware-as-a-Service network. This attack is one of the most comprehensive ever against South Korea, and the country's authorities have elevated preparedness for the financial sector as a result.

  **Ransomware Surge Context:** South Korea became the second-most affected country by ransomware after the US in September 2025, with 25 cases – a dramatic jump from an average of about 2 victims per month between September 2024 and August 2025.

### Qilin Ransomware Group Activity

- **Period:** October 2025
- **Attribution:** Qilin Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
- **Global Activity:** Over 180 victims claimed in October 2025
- **Market Share:** Responsible for 29% of all ransomware attacks (per NCC Group data)
- **Details:** Qilin emerged as one of the most active ransomware operations in 2025, exhibiting "explosive growth" in October by claiming over 180 victims globally. The group operates as a Ransomware-as-a-Service platform, taking a small share (up to 20%) of illicit payments while affiliates carry out the attacks.

  One particular affiliate of note is Moonstone Sleet, a North Korean state-sponsored actor that, according to Microsoft, has deployed a custom ransomware variant called FakePenny in attacks targeting defense companies. This convergence of state and criminal operations represents an emerging trend in the threat landscape.

## India

### October 21, 2025 – Dukaan – Massive E-Commerce Data Exposure

- **Date:** October 21, 2025 (vulnerability existed for over 2 years)
- **Target:** Dukaan (Indian e-commerce platform, "Shopify-rival")
- **Attack Type:** Security misconfiguration / Unauthorized data access
- **Attribution:** Security researchers (vulnerability disclosure)
- **Impact:** 
  - Over 3.5 million sellers affected
  - 16 million customers' data exposed
  - Sensitive data compromised:
    - Order data
    - Customer details (names, contact info, purchase history)
    - API keys and payment tokens for Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay
    - Merchant credentials
- **Details:** The Indian e-commerce platform Dukaan – known as a "Shopify-rival" for online stores – was revealed to have a serious security flaw. Over 3.5 million sellers and 16 million customers had sensitive data exposed due to unauthorized connection to an unencrypted Apache Kafka data stream.

  Attackers could in practice see order data, customer details (names, contact info, purchase history) and – most critically – API keys and payment tokens for Dukaan's integrated payment services (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay). The vulnerability was open for over two years before being discovered, and could in the worst case have allowed theft of funds.

  The leak was first reported by security news site Cybernews and created shockwaves in India's startup ecosystem. The incident highlights the enormous consequences a single configuration error can have and the need for stricter cloud storage security.

### 2025 Overall – India Cyber Attack Statistics

- **Period:** Full year 2025
- **Total Attacks:** 265.52 million malware detections across 8+ million endpoints
- **Attack Composition:**
  - Trojans and File Infectors: 70% of all attacks
- **Most Affected Regions:**
  - Maharashtra
  - Gujarat
  - Delhi
- **Most Targeted Cities:**
  - Mumbai
  - Kolkata
  - New Delhi
- **Most Affected Sectors:**
  - Education
  - Healthcare
  - Manufacturing
  - Combined: Nearly 47% of all detections
- **Details:** India faced over 265 million cyberattacks in 2025 according to Seqrite's India Cyber Threat Report 2026, released by Quick Heal Technologies Limited. The report, developed by Seqrite Labs (India's largest malware analysis center), presents a clear picture of a threat landscape accelerating at a pace affecting every sector.

  October 2025 was part of this intense threat phase. Indian states like Maharashtra and Gujarat were among the most exposed regions. The massive volume reflects both widespread vulnerable systems and aggressive scanning/infection campaigns by threat actors.

  In response, India launched new Digital Risk Protection services through state CERT-In to help businesses detect data leakage and avert ransomware attacks.

## Regional Trends and Analysis

### Supply Chain as Attack Vector

The Korean Leaks campaign exemplifies how compromising a single MSP can cascade into dozens of organizational breaches. This supply chain attack methodology has become increasingly prevalent across Asia, with service providers representing high-value targets that provide access to multiple downstream victims.

### Convergence of State and Criminal Activity

The Moonstone Sleet / Qilin collaboration represents a significant trend: the blurring boundary between state-sponsored operations and financially-motivated cybercrime. North Korea's participation in ransomware attacks demonstrates how nations use criminal methods for economic gain, complicating attribution and response.

### Critical Infrastructure Vulnerabilities

While the October attacks in Asia primarily targeted commercial entities, the broader pattern (including power grid attacks in Europe) raises concerns about critical infrastructure security across the region. Japanese and other Asian authorities have warned that energy, transportation, and telecommunications infrastructure could be next targets.

### Massive Volume Attacks

India's 265+ million blocked attacks in 2025 indicates the scale of opportunistic scanning and infection attempts across Asia. This high-volume activity combines with targeted operations, creating a two-tier threat landscape requiring both mass-scale defensive measures and sophisticated threat hunting capabilities.

## Impact Assessment

- **28+ organizations** compromised in Korean supply chain campaign
- **2+ TB** of data stolen in Korean Leaks
- **19.5+ million** individuals affected in Dukaan exposure
- **265+ million** cyberattacks against India in 2025
- **180+ victims** claimed by Qilin globally in October
- **Multiple nation-states** conducting operations in region
- **Financial sector** heavily targeted in South Korea
