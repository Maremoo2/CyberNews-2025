# Cybersecurity Incidents – March 2025

## Global Overview

### Trends & Analysis

March 2025 saw a surge of cyber incidents worldwide, spanning cloud services, software supply chains, cryptocurrency platforms, and critical infrastructure. Over 5 million individuals were affected by breaches this month, with damages exceeding $39.9 million (from just three breach settlements). Industry analysis projected a 12.2% increase in global cybersecurity spending in 2025 due to escalating threats and AI-enhanced attacks.

Notably, state-backed hacking surged – for instance, North Korea's Lazarus Group pulled off a record $1.5 billion crypto heist from exchange Bybit (the largest ever). Security experts note a continued blurring of lines between nation-state and criminal actors, with tools from espionage campaigns being repurposed for profit-driven attacks.

## Major Global Incidents

### Early Mar 2025 – Oracle Cloud – Cloud Data Breach

- **Attack Type:** Cloud data breach (supply chain)
- **Impact:** ~6 million records stolen (SSO credentials, LDAP credentials, Java KeyStore files, key authentication data); over 140,000 Oracle Cloud tenants worldwide impacted
- **Attribution:** Threat actor "rose87168"
- **Details:** A hacker claimed to breach Oracle's cloud infrastructure, stealing encrypted SSO and LDAP credentials, Java KeyStore files, and other key authentication data. The actor began selling the data on BreachForums while attempting to extort affected organizations. Oracle initially denied a breach but later notified customers, attributing it to legacy, outdated systems – an explanation that drew skepticism. The breach demonstrated how supply-chain vulnerabilities can impact massive numbers of downstream customers.

### Mar 2025 – GitHub (Actions) – Supply Chain Attack

- **Attack Type:** Supply chain attack (CI/CD)
- **Impact:** CI/CD secrets exposed from at least 218 software repositories across 4,000+ organizations globally
- **Attribution:** Unknown
- **Details:** A cascading supply chain attack targeting GitHub Actions exploited mutable version tags to spread widely across the developer ecosystem. The breach demonstrated how a single compromised action can infect numerous projects downstream, exposing sensitive CI/CD secrets and authentication tokens used in software build pipelines across thousands of organizations.

### Mar 10, 2025 – X (Twitter) – DDoS Attack

- **Attack Type:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- **Impact:** Global outages for hours with intermittent downtime across regions
- **Attribution:** Dark Storm hacker group (and possibly others including Anonymous)
- **Details:** Social media platform X suffered global outages for hours. CEO Elon Musk blamed a "massive" cyberattack, and internet monitors observed patterns consistent with a large-scale DDoS on X's infrastructure. Multiple hacker groups including Dark Storm and Anonymous claimed responsibility, highlighting the persistent threat to major online platforms.

### Mar 2025 – Global Cryptocurrency Platforms – Crypto Theft

- **Attack Type:** Cryptocurrency theft
- **Impact:** $1.5B stolen from Bybit (largest crypto hack ever); $6.1M stolen from WEMIX
- **Attribution:** Lazarus Group (North Korea) for Bybit
- **Details:** Cryptocurrency services faced severe hits in March. Notably, Bybit exchange was hacked (allegedly by Lazarus Group) in a $1.5B theft of digital tokens, making it the largest cryptocurrency hack in history. The stolen funds reportedly made North Korea the world's third-largest holder of Bitcoin overnight. Separately, WEMIX, a blockchain gaming network, lost 8.65 million tokens (≈$6.1M) after attackers stole an authentication key. These incidents underscore the growing cyber risk in crypto and how threat actors are exploiting trust relationships and keys to pull off large-scale heists.

### Late Mar 2025 – Global Malvertising Campaign

- **Attack Type:** Malvertising / Malware distribution
- **Impact:** Nearly 1 million devices compromised worldwide (including Europe)
- **Attribution:** Unknown cybercriminal group
- **Details:** Microsoft uncovered a malvertising campaign that compromised nearly 1 million devices worldwide via malicious ads on illicit streaming sites. Once downloaded, the payloads performed system discovery, credential harvesting, data exfiltration, and established persistence through Windows registry keys and startup folder shortcuts. Additional payloads were delivered using PowerShell, VBScript, and AutoIT scripts, with some variants targeting cryptocurrency wallets and browser credential stores.
