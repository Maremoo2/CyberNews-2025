# March 2025 - European Union Summary

## Overview

March 2025 saw the European Union take significant steps in cybersecurity regulation and enforcement, while simultaneously facing targeted cyber attacks on government infrastructure and major data breaches affecting millions of EU citizens. The month was characterized by new legislative proposals to streamline cyber incident reporting and enhanced GDPR enforcement actions focused on data erasure rights.

## Key Trends

### Regulatory Developments

The European Commission proposed a comprehensive "Digital Omnibus" package aimed at simplifying the overlapping tech regulations covering data protection, AI, and cybersecurity. A centerpiece of this initiative is the Single Reporting Portal for cyber incidents, which will merge requirements under NIS2, GDPR, DORA, and other frameworks into one unified interface. This "report-once, share-many" approach is expected to save businesses up to €5 billion by 2029 and significantly reduce compliance burdens.

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) also launched a coordinated enforcement action on the "right to be forgotten" under GDPR Article 17, with 30 Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) across Europe plus the EDPS participating throughout 2025 to ensure consistent application of data erasure rights.

### Cyber Attacks on Government Infrastructure

Several EU member states experienced cyber attacks on government infrastructure. Poland's Space Agency (POLSA) suffered an email compromise attack that disrupted operations. Belgium faced politically motivated DDoS attacks from Russian hacker collective NoName057 targeting government websites including MyGov.be and the Walloon Parliament, though defensive measures limited disruption.

### Major Data Breaches

The most significant data breach in the EU region was the SportAdmin incident in Sweden, where personal data of approximately 2 million Swedish citizens was leaked on the darknet. The breach exposed data of individuals with protected identities, high-profile politicians, and members of the Swedish royal family. Sweden's privacy authority (IMY) has clarified that the investigation remains open with about 20 complaints filed.

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

European organizations were affected by global supply chain attacks, particularly the NTT Communications breach in Japan which exposed data of approximately 18,000 corporate customers (including European multinationals) and the Oracle Cloud breach affecting over 140,000 tenants worldwide.

## Impact Assessment

- **Millions of EU citizens** affected by data breaches (2M+ in Sweden alone)
- **Critical infrastructure** targeted by state-sponsored actors
- **Significant regulatory changes** expected to save €5B+ by 2029
- **Enhanced GDPR enforcement** through coordinated 30+ DPA action
- **Supply chain risks** highlighted through global breaches affecting EU entities

## Looking Ahead

The EU's regulatory initiatives demonstrate a commitment to both simplifying compliance requirements and strengthening enforcement of existing data protection laws. However, the continued targeting of government infrastructure by state-sponsored actors and the exposure of millions of citizens' data in breaches underscore the ongoing challenges in maintaining robust cybersecurity across member states.
