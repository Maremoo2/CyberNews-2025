## New Regulations/Legislation

### 5 Mar 2025 – EU Right-to-Erasure Enforcement – GDPR Coordination

- **Date:** March 5, 2025
- **Initiative:** Coordinated Enforcement Framework (CEF) 2025
- **Details:** The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) launched a coordinated enforcement action focused on the "right to be forgotten" under GDPR Article 17. Throughout 2025, 30 Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) across Europe (plus the EDPS) will investigate how organizations handle erasure requests, checking compliance with conditions and exceptions in Article 17. This joint effort aims to ensure consistent application of data erasure rights, with findings to be analyzed for EU-wide follow-ups. The initiative reflects the EU's increasing regulatory vigilance on data protection enforcement.

### March 2025 – Digital Rulebook Simplification – Legislative Proposals

- **Date:** March 2025
- **Initiative:** Digital Omnibus Package
- **Details:** The European Commission in March proposed a "Digital Omnibus" package to streamline overlapping tech regulations (covering data, AI, and cybersecurity). A key element is a Single Reporting Portal for cyber incidents, merging requirements under NIS2, GDPR, DORA, etc., into one interface. This "report-once, share-many" approach (with harmonized templates and extended timelines) is expected to save businesses up to €5 billion by 2029 and reduce compliance burdens. The proposal, which includes revisions to the Cybersecurity Act, was under discussion by EU bodies in early 2025 as part of efforts to modernize and simplify digital compliance. A new Article 23a NIS2 will establish the single-entry point and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity's (ENISA) role, and set interoperability, access, and compatibility requirements (e.g., with European Business Wallets), enabling re-use of a single notification to satisfy multiple legal obligations.

The attacks caused limited disruption thanks to defensive measures, with Belgian authorities reporting little success for the attackers. These incidents came amid heightened tensions, as European governments braced for retaliatory cyber actions by pro-Russian groups over EU support for Ukraine.

## Threat Warnings

### Late Mar 2025 – EU Institutions & Companies – Threat Warnings

- **Date:** Late March 2025
- **Details:** EU cybersecurity agencies warned of increased phishing and malware targeting European organizations. For example, a malvertising campaign uncovered by Microsoft compromised nearly 1 million devices worldwide (including Europe) via ads on illicit streaming sites. European businesses were urged to patch known vulnerabilities and tighten supply-chain security, especially after the NTT Communications breach in Japan (18,000 corporate clients' data exposed) which raised alarms for multinationals operating in Europe.
