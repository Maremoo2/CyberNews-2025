# March 2025 - Norway Summary

## Overview

March 2025 marked a critical period for Norwegian cybersecurity, with the discovery of a significant breach at Narvik Havn (Port of Narvik), heightened threat warnings from national security agencies, and proactive government initiatives to strengthen the country's cyber resilience. Norwegian authorities emphasized that the nation faces "increasing and unpredictable" cyber threats from state-backed actors, particularly Russia, with critical infrastructure remaining a prime target.

## Key Trends

### Narvik Havn Data Breach

A previously unknown hacker group breached the Norwegian port authority of Narvik in March, stealing approximately 10 GB of data and encrypting two servers. The attackers demanded a ransom after copying out the data (about 10 out of 151 GB in the system). The breach wasn't publicly discovered until June when Narvik's data appeared on dark web leak sites. Fortunately, the stolen documents were 10-15-year-old files and not of sensitive value (no critical security plans were compromised). Narvik Havn, a key NATO logistics port, worked with NorCERT and police to investigate.

### Escalating Threat Landscape

Norwegian authorities entered 2025 on high alert due to heightened cyber threats linked to the geopolitical situation. In its annual assessment, PST (Norwegian Security Service) warned of "increasing and unpredictable" cyber threats from state-backed actors, particularly Russia, which may target Norway's critical infrastructure. The head of NSM (Norwegian Security Authority) echoed that too many Norwegian organizations are "open as barn doors" in terms of cyber defense. This was evidenced when pro-Russian hackers briefly disrupted a Norwegian dam control system in early April – a wake-up call about potential sabotage.

### Energy Sector Vulnerability

Norway's long coastline and extensive supplier industry make the power sector a primary target for state-sponsored cyberattacks through the supply chain. A concerning 77% of Norwegian energy sector actors believe their organizations are more vulnerable than ever to cyberattacks against operational technology (OT) environments. The criticality of Norwegian power for both Norway and Europe (especially after the war in Ukraine) demands targeted security measures.

## Government Initiatives

### Digital Security Act

The Norwegian government has been proactive in bolstering cyber resilience. A new Digital Security Act ("Digitalsikkerhetsloven") was rolled out, effective 2025, to impose baseline cybersecurity requirements on companies vital to society. Under this law, critical infrastructure operators must implement risk assessments, incident reporting, and access controls per NIS2 and EU standards.

### Public-Private Cooperation

By April, the national cyber coordination center (NCC-NO) awarded 20 million NOK in grants to 33 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for cybersecurity upgrades, funded partly by the EU. This investment reflects Norway's commitment to strengthening cybersecurity across all sectors, not just large corporations.

### Nordic-Baltic Cyber Defense Consortium

Norway joined a Nordic-Baltic cyber defense consortium with six neighboring countries to improve threat intelligence sharing and jointly prevent attacks across the region. This collaborative approach recognizes that cyber threats transcend national borders and require coordinated regional responses.

## Impact Assessment

- **Narvik Havn breach:** 10 GB of data stolen, 2 servers encrypted (legacy data, no critical compromise)
- **National threat level:** High alert for state-sponsored attacks on critical infrastructure
- **Energy sector:** 77% of actors feel more vulnerable than ever
- **Government investment:** 20 million NOK in SME cybersecurity grants
- **Regional cooperation:** 7-country Nordic-Baltic cyber defense consortium established

## Looking Ahead

The situation at Narvik Havn, along with recent attacks on other Norwegian entities (like media outlet Altaposten and Gran municipality), underscores that even Scandinavia's essential services are not immune to cyber threats. NSM urged companies to strengthen emergency plans and practice incident response, especially in sectors like energy. The combination of new legislation, increased investment, and regional cooperation demonstrates Norway's recognition that robust cyber defense is a national priority amid an increasingly hostile digital threat environment.
