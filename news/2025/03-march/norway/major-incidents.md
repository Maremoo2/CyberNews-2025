# March 2025 - Norway Major Incidents

## National Cyber Incidents

### Mar 2025 – Narvik Havn (Port of Narvik) – Data Breach & Ransomware

- **Date:** March 2025 (discovered publicly in June 2025)
- **Target:** Narvik Havn (Port of Narvik)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach and ransomware
- **Impact:** Approximately 10 GB of data stolen and two servers encrypted; ransom demanded
- **Attribution:** Previously unknown hacker group
- **Details:** A previously unknown hacker group breached the Norwegian port authority of Narvik in March, stealing ~10 GB of data and encrypting two servers. The attackers demanded a ransom after copying out the data (about 10 out of 151 GB in the system). The breach wasn't discovered publicly until June when Narvik's data appeared on dark web leak sites. Fortunately, the stolen documents were 10-15-year-old files and not of sensitive value (no critical security plans were compromised). Narvik Havn, a key NATO logistics port, worked with NorCERT and police to investigate. This incident, along with recent attacks on other Norwegian entities (like media outlet Altaposten and Gran municipality), underscores that even Scandinavia's essential services are not immune to cyber threats.

## Threat Landscape 2025

### National Security Service (PST) – High Alert

- **Date:** 2025 Annual Assessment (ongoing through March)
- **Assessment:** High threat level
- **Details:** Norwegian authorities entered 2025 on alert due to heightened cyber threats linked to the geopolitical situation. In its annual assessment, PST (Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste - Norwegian Security Service) warned of "increasing and unpredictable" cyber threats from state-backed actors, particularly Russia, which may target Norway's critical infrastructure. The head of NSM (Nasjonal sikkerhetsmyndighet - Norwegian Security Authority) echoed that too many Norwegian organizations are "open as barn doors" in terms of cyber defense. E-tjenesten (Norwegian Intelligence Service) stated that the world has become more dangerous over the past year.

### Dam Control System Disruption

- **Date:** Early April 2025 (incident emerged from March reconnaissance)
- **Details:** Pro-Russian hackers briefly disrupted a Norwegian dam control system in early April – a wake-up call about potential sabotage. The incident is under investigation by PST. This demonstrated that critical infrastructure targeting is not theoretical but actively occurring, underscoring the urgency of cybersecurity measures.

## Energy Sector Vulnerability

### Critical Infrastructure at Risk

- **Date:** March 2025 (ongoing assessment)
- **Sector:** Energy and Power
- **Details:** Norway's long coastline and extensive supplier industry make the power sector a primary target for state-sponsored cyberattacks through the supply chain. A concerning 77% of Norwegian energy sector actors believe their organizations are more vulnerable than ever to cyberattacks against operational technology (OT) environments. Norwegian power has become even more critical to secure for both Norway and Europe after the war in Ukraine. This requires targeted security measures and increased vigilance.

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### New Digital Security Act

- **Date:** Effective 2025
- **Initiative:** Digitalsikkerhetsloven (Digital Security Act)
- **Details:** The Norwegian government rolled out a new Digital Security Act ("Digitalsikkerhetsloven") effective 2025 to impose baseline cybersecurity requirements on companies vital to society. Under this law, critical infrastructure operators must implement risk assessments, incident reporting, and access controls per NIS2 and EU standards. NSM offers Norwegian businesses guidance on the new law and regulations.

### Cybersjekk - Digital Security Assessment Tool

- **Date:** August 20, 2025 (launched)
- **Initiative:** Cybersjekk tool by NSM
- **Details:** NSM makes it easier for organizations to protect against digital threats. Cybersjekk gives businesses a quick overview of their security status and follows up with concrete measures to improve security. This tool is part of NSM's effort to make cybersecurity accessible to organizations of all sizes.

### EU Support for Cybersecurity

- **Date:** April 3, 2025
- **Initiative:** EU funding for Norwegian SMEs
- **Details:** 33 small and medium-sized enterprises receive a total of nearly 20 million NOK for the development of cybersecurity measures from NCC-NO (National Cyber Coordination Center Norway). The funding is partly supported by the EU, demonstrating international commitment to strengthening Norway's cybersecurity ecosystem.

### Nordic-Baltic Cyber Defense Consortium

- **Date:** December 17, 2025 (established)
- **Initiative:** Regional cyber cooperation
- **Details:** Norway joined a Nordic-Baltic cyber defense consortium with six neighboring countries to improve threat intelligence sharing and jointly prevent attacks across the region. The initiative recognizes that cyberattacks know no borders, and seven countries have joined forces to better analyze, detect, and prevent cyberattacks across the Nordic and Baltic regions. This reflects Norway's commitment to regional cybersecurity cooperation.

### NSM Warning on Dam Control Systems

- **Date:** March-April 2025
- **Initiative:** Critical infrastructure alert
- **Details:** NSM has observed activity directed at digital infrastructure linked to water industry, dam facilities, and similar installations in Norway. NSM has a clear call to Norwegian businesses: Have clear emergency plans and practice them. In March, NSM urged companies to strengthen emergency plans and practice incident response, especially in sectors like energy where vulnerabilities are highest.

## Context and Analysis

March 2025 was characterized by a heightened threat environment for Norway, with multiple factors converging:

1. **Active Targeting:** The Narvik Havn breach and dam control system reconnaissance demonstrate that Norwegian critical infrastructure is being actively targeted by threat actors.

2. **State-Sponsored Threats:** PST and NSM warnings about Russian state-backed threats reflect the geopolitical tensions following the war in Ukraine and Norway's strategic importance to European energy security.

3. **Energy Sector Focus:** With 77% of energy sector actors feeling more vulnerable, and Norway's critical role in European energy supply, the power sector remains a prime target.

4. **Proactive Government Response:** The Digital Security Act, Cybersjekk tool, EU funding for SMEs, and Nordic-Baltic consortium show Norway is taking comprehensive steps to strengthen national cyber resilience.

5. **Regional Cooperation:** Recognition that cyber threats transcend borders led to enhanced cooperation with Nordic and Baltic neighbors, creating a stronger collective defense posture.

The combination of actual incidents, high threat warnings, and proactive measures illustrates that Norway is treating cybersecurity as a national security priority requiring both defensive vigilance and international cooperation.
