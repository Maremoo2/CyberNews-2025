This ambitious operation targeted networks of the state-run NITC and IRISL, which are critical to Iran's oil exports. The attackers bragged that they struck a major blow to Iran's maritime infrastructure. Iranian officials did not publicly confirm the extent, but Western observers called it one of the biggest cyber-attacks on Iran's shipping sector to date. The incident highlights the intensity of regional cyber warfare in the Middle East and Asia.

### Ongoing – APT Campaigns (China & North Korea) – Espionage and Theft

- **Date:** March 2025 (ongoing)
- **Attribution:** Chinese state-linked APTs and North Korea's Lazarus Group
- **Details:** In March, cybersecurity firms reported persistent espionage by Chinese state-linked hackers targeting Asian neighbors' government networks, and continued cryptocurrency theft by North Korea's Lazarus Group. The Lazarus-attributed Bybit hack exemplifies how state actors are funding operations via cybercrime. Separate reports indicated Chinese APTs probing Japanese and Taiwanese critical systems, seeking intelligence on semiconductor supply chains. These underscore emerging trends in Asia: state-sponsored groups blending financial cybercrime with traditional espionage to advance geopolitical goals.

## Major Incidents – China, Japan, Korea, India

### Feb 28–Mar 2025 – WEMIX (South Korea) – Cryptocurrency Theft

- **Date:** February 28, 2025 (confirmed in March)
- **Target:** WEMIX (Blockchain gaming platform)
- **Attack Type:** Cryptocurrency theft via authentication key compromise
- **Impact:** 8,654,860 WEMIX tokens stolen (worth approximately $6.1 million)
- **Attribution:** Unknown (possible insider or supply-chain vector)
- **Details:** Blockchain gaming platform WEMIX announced that hackers stole 8,654,860 WEMIX tokens from its DeFi network. The breach occurred on February 28 but was confirmed by WEMIX's CEO in March after a delay (the team initially held back public disclosure to prevent further exploits). Attackers obtained an authentication key, suggesting a possible insider or supply-chain vector. The stolen tokens were liquidated, and law enforcement in Seoul is investigating. This hack, hitting a prominent Korean crypto project, highlights vulnerabilities in decentralized finance platforms.

### Mar 2025 – NTT Communications (Japan) – Customer Data Breach

- **Date:** March 2025 (breach initially detected February 5, 2025)
- **Target:** NTT Communications (major telecom and IT services provider)
- **Attack Type:** Cyberattack on Order Management system
- **Impact:** Data of approximately 18,000 corporate customers exposed (company names, contact persons, contract details, emails)
- **Attribution:** Unknown
- **Details:** Tokyo-based NTT Communications confirmed a cyberattack that exposed data of ~18,000 corporate customers. Initially detected on February 5, the breach involved NTT's Order Management system. Stolen information included company names, contact persons, contract details, and emails. NTT contained the attack by isolating affected servers, but for transparency it publicly disclosed the incident in March (choosing not to individually notify each client). The NTT breach sent ripples through Japan's business community, given NTT's central role – it underscored supply-chain risks and led the government to urge improved cloud security standards.

### Mar 2025 – Tata Technologies (India) – Ransomware Data Leak

- **Date:** March 2025 (attack occurred January 2025)
- **Target:** Tata Technologies
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware data exfiltration and leak
- **Impact:** Over 1.4 TB of data dumped (730,000+ files containing employee records, purchase orders, contracts, etc.)
- **Attribution:** Hunters International ransomware group (rebranded Hive gang)
- **Details:** In March, the Hunters International ransomware group dumped over 1.4 TB of data purportedly stolen from Tata Technologies. The leak – containing 730,000+ files with employee records, purchase orders, contracts, etc. – came after a January attack that Tata had initially downplayed. Hunters International, which focuses on data exfiltration over encryption, published the trove on its dark web site to pressure Tata. This breach of a prominent Indian tech firm (part of the Tata conglomerate) highlights the evolution of ransomware tactics: groups increasingly skip file encryption and go straight to data theft and extortion. Tata is now reinforcing its network segmentation and notifying affected partners as investigators assess the damage.

## Emerging Trends

### Mid Mar 2025 – Bybit Cryptocurrency Exchange – Record Crypto Heist

- **Date:** Mid-March 2025
- **Target:** Bybit (leading cryptocurrency exchange)
- **Attack Type:** Supply chain attack via third-party wallet supplier
- **Impact:** $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency stolen (largest crypto hack ever)
- **Attribution:** North Korea's Lazarus Group (alleged)
- **Details:** A staggering $1.5 billion in crypto was stolen from Bybit (a leading exchange with many Asian users) in what is being called the largest crypto hack ever. Intelligence reports allege North Korea's Lazarus Group infiltrated a third-party wallet supplier for Bybit, altering deposit addresses to siphon funds. 

  Bybit's CEO affirmed the hack and noted much of the loot is traceable on the blockchain, with efforts underway to freeze or recover assets. The hack's scale propelled North Korea to be the world's third-largest holder of Bitcoin overnight. This incident exemplifies an emerging trend where state-backed hackers target cryptocurrency at unprecedented scale to evade sanctions – a major concern for Asia-Pacific financial regulators.

### Late Mar 2025 – Pakistan & India CERTs – Critical Vulnerability Alerts

- **Date:** Late March 2025
- **Initiative:** Regional CERT coordination
- **Details:** Computer emergency teams in Asia issued urgent alerts for several newly discovered vulnerabilities. Notably, CERT-In (India) warned of active exploitation of a Windows server flaw in South Asian networks, and PakCERT highlighted phishing campaigns targeting government email domains. These advisories indicate a broader trend of cross-border cyber threat sharing in Asia, as nations brace against common threats. Cooperation through ASEAN and inter-country CERT tie-ups was visible in March, reflecting a growing recognition that Asian economies must coordinate on cybersecurity due to the transnational nature of attacks.
