# March 2025 - US Major Incidents

## Major Data Breaches

### Mar 22, 2025 – New York University (NYU) – Website Breach & Data Leak

- **Date:** March 22, 2025
- **Target:** New York University (NYU)
- **Attack Type:** Website breach, data leak, defacement
- **Impact:** Data on over 3 million applicants leaked, including personal information (names, addresses, GPAs, demographics) from as far back as 1989
- **Attribution:** Unknown hacktivist (claimed previous university hacks)
- **Details:** A hacker defaced NYU's website, replacing the homepage with charts of student test scores and leaking data categorizing standardized testing scores based on race. The attacker accessed an internal data warehouse. While the hacker claimed personal information was redacted, cybersecurity expert Zack Ganot found that over 1 million people's personal information was exposed, including full names, addresses, phone numbers, grade point averages, email addresses, citizenship status, and financial aid information. NYU restored the site within hours and is investigating with law enforcement. A class-action lawsuit has been filed alleging security failures. The cybercriminal claims these attacks are in response to the Supreme Court decision in 2023 striking down affirmative action.

Hackers breached the network in December 2024, but only in March did forensic analysis confirm the scope. The attackers threatened to leak stolen medical data unless an $800,000 ransom was paid. Sunflower notified regulators in multiple states and enhanced its network monitoring as a result.

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Mar 2025 – FBI & CISA Alert – Ransomware Advisory

- **Date:** March 2025
- **Initiative:** Joint Cybersecurity Advisory
- **Details:** U.S. agencies (FBI, CISA and others) issued a joint cybersecurity advisory warning Gmail and Outlook email users of a Medusa ransomware campaign spreading across industries. The alert described a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model using double extortion (encrypting files and stealing data for added leverage). The Medusa hackers employ sophisticated methods to target victims and cover their tracks. Officials urged basic security steps – enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), caution with email links/attachments, and prompt password changes if a malicious link is clicked – to counter the threat. This reflects a broader government push in March to educate organizations on rising ransomware risks.

### Mar 2025 – U.S. House of Representatives – App Ban (Security Policy)

- **Date:** March 2025 (late March memo)
- **Initiative:** WhatsApp ban on official devices
- **Details:** The House IT office banned lawmakers and staff from using WhatsApp on official devices, citing "lack of transparency in how it protects data" and potential security risks. A memo in late March instructed House members to use approved secure apps (like Signal or Wickr) instead. WhatsApp's owner Meta objected, claiming its end-to-end encryption is robust, but Congress deemed the foreign-controlled messaging app a liability. This move came as U.S. officials grew wary of spyware targeting popular chat apps and followed other federal restrictions on high-risk software.

### Mar 2025 – CISA Workforce & Strategy – Agency Changes

- **Date:** March 2025 (ongoing from February layoffs)
- **Initiative:** CISA workforce crisis
- **Details:** The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency faced internal challenges after over 4% of its staff were laid off in February 2025 under cost-cutting measures by the new administration. In March, CISA leadership scrambled to rehire critical personnel (some by court order) and reassure stakeholders. The layoffs included highly experienced security professionals making up a significant portion of the agency's mission-critical staff, as well as contractors filling vital roles. Critics warned that the cuts, driven by non-cyber policymakers, could undermine federal cyber defenses. The chaos contributed to growing concerns that there may be irreversible and costly damages done to controls the government has in place against foreign bad actors, including protections for state and municipal agencies against state-sponsored hackers.

The exact strain (ransomware suspected) wasn't disclosed, and investigators were engaged to restore systems.

  These cases show ransomware's toll on public services, prompting federal officials to expedite cyber aid to state and local agencies.
