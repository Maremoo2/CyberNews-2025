# March 2025 - United States Summary

## Overview

March 2025 was a tumultuous month for U.S. cybersecurity, marked by high-profile data breaches affecting millions, ransomware attacks crippling critical services, and significant policy developments at the federal level. 

The month saw breaches at major institutions including NYU (3 million+ records), attacks on healthcare providers, banks, and food supply chains, plus controversial changes at CISA that raised concerns about national cyber defense capabilities.

## Key Trends

### Major Data Breaches

The most prominent breach was at New York University (NYU), where a hacker defaced the website and leaked data on over 3 million applicants dating back to 1989, including names, addresses, GPAs, test scores, and demographic information. The attacker claimed the breach was a protest against affirmative action policies. Other significant breaches included Western Alliance Bank (22,000 customers via third-party vendor) and Sunflower Medical Group (221,000 patients via Rhysida ransomware).

### Ransomware and Supply Chain Attacks

Ransomware continued to plague both private sector and government entities. United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI), a major grocery distributor for Whole Foods, suffered a cyberattack that disrupted shipments nationwide. Multiple U.S. municipalities were hit, including Mission, Texas (state of emergency declared), Cleveland Municipal Court (offline for three weeks), and police departments in New Hampshire and Connecticut. National Presto Industries also reported manufacturing delays due to a cyberattack.

### Government Cybersecurity Initiatives and Challenges

The FBI and CISA issued a joint advisory warning about the Medusa ransomware campaign targeting Gmail and Outlook users across industries. However, CISA itself faced internal turmoil after over 4% of its workforce was laid off in February 2025 under cost-cutting measures. In March, CISA leadership scrambled to rehire critical personnel (some by court order), with critics warning that the cuts could undermine federal cyber defenses.

The U.S. House of Representatives banned WhatsApp on official devices citing data protection concerns, instructing staff to use approved secure apps like Signal or Wickr instead. This reflected growing wariness about foreign-controlled messaging apps and potential spyware risks.

## Impact Assessment

- **Over 3 million individuals** affected by the NYU breach alone
- **243,000+ individuals** affected by healthcare and banking breaches combined
- **Multiple municipalities** declared emergencies or experienced weeks-long system outages
- **Critical supply chains** disrupted (food distribution, manufacturing)
- **Federal cybersecurity agency** weakened by workforce cuts
- **Billions in damages** from ransomware attacks and operational disruptions

## Looking Ahead

The concentration of ransomware attacks on local governments highlights the vulnerability of state and municipal agencies with limited cybersecurity resources. The internal challenges at CISA raised concerns about the U.S. government's ability to coordinate national cyber defense effectively. Meanwhile, the continued success of social engineering and third-party vendor compromises underscored that attackers are exploiting basic security gaps rather than sophisticated zero-day vulnerabilities.
