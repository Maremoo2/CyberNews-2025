# June 2025 - EU Summary

## Overview

The European Union's cybersecurity landscape in June 2025 was characterized by significant policy advancements alongside ongoing cyber threats. While the region experienced fewer large-scale breaches compared to other areas, the month was marked by important regulatory developments and continued targeting of both private companies and public sector organizations.

## Key Trends

### Regulatory Leadership

June 2025 demonstrated the EU's continued leadership in cybersecurity regulation:

- **Cybersecurity Blueprint Adoption:** The Council of the European Union adopted a revised crisis management framework
- **NIS2 Guidance:** ENISA published detailed compliance expectations for organizations
- **Harmonization Efforts:** Push toward unified incident response across member states
- **Implementation Challenges:** Only about half of EU states had fully implemented NIS2 locally by late June

### Targeted Attacks on Critical Sectors

The month saw continued targeting of key sectors:

- **Luxury Retail:** Scattered Spider group targeting fashion brands (Cartier)
- **Municipal Services:** Ransomware attacks on local governments (Glasgow)
- **Transportation:** Supply chain attacks affecting airlines
- **Manufacturing:** Vendor credential theft (Scania)

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Multiple incidents highlighted third-party risks:

- Scania breach via stolen vendor credentials
- WestJet disruption through IT provider compromise
- British Airways partner system attacks

### State-Sponsored Threats

EU institutions and member states faced ongoing espionage attempts:

- Phishing campaigns impersonating EU officials
- Targeted attempts against ministry networks
- Heightened alert due to geopolitical tensions

## New Regulations and Legislation

### EU Cybersecurity Blueprint (June 6, 2025)

On June 6, 2025, the Council of the European Union adopted a revised Cybersecurity Crisis Management Blueprint through Council Recommendation COM(2025) 66. This updated framework replaces the 2017 guidelines and defines how the EU, Member States, and EU agencies will jointly respond to large-scale cyber incidents.

#### Key Features:

- **Five Crisis Stages:** Detection, analysis, escalation, response, and recovery
- **Severity Levels:** Five-level scale from Level 0 (Normal) to Level 4 (Crisis)
  - **Level 0:** No incident; standard monitoring
  - **Level 1:** Minor localized incident, no cross-border effects
  - **Level 2:** Limited cross-border or cross-sector impact; information-sharing initiated
  - **Level 3:** Major incident affecting multiple Member States; EU-CyCLONe coordination triggered
  - **Level 4:** Systemic event with Union-wide consequences; strategic response

#### EU-CyCLONe Enhancement:

The blueprint strengthens EU-CyCLONe (Cyber Crisis Liaison Network) under the NIS2 Directive as a central hub for crisis communication among national authorities. Each member state designates at least one competent authority to participate in the network, typically linked to national crisis management structures.

#### Rationale:

This move towards unified incident response was prompted by growing threats to European critical infrastructure and the need for streamlined cross-border coordination during major cyber crises.

### NIS2 Compliance Guidance (June 26, 2025)

On June 26, 2025, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) published detailed guidance documents outlining the security measures that organizations must implement under the new NIS2 Directive.

#### Key Requirements:

- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Mandatory on all internet-facing systems (email, remote desktop, VPNs)
- **Documentation:** Configuration logs to prove compliance
- **ISO 27001 Alignment:** Mapping to international standards
- **Comprehensive Scope:** Nearly 200 pages of security measures

#### Implementation Expectations:

The guidance, though not legally binding, clarifies ENISA's expectations and builds upon both the NIS2 text and the European Commission's NIS2 Implementing Regulation 2024/2690. It highlights significant investments companies will need to make in:

- Incident response planning
- Access controls and authentication
- Third-party risk management
- Network segmentation
- Continuous monitoring

#### Compliance Challenges:

As of late June, only about half of EU member states had fully implemented NIS2 into national law. The guidance serves to jump-start compliance across the Union, despite continued complaints from the European Commission about implementation delays.

### Other EU Regulatory Moves

#### Cyber Resilience Act

The European Parliament continued debating the proposed Cyber Resilience Act to impose security-by-design requirements on products throughout their lifecycle.

#### EU Cybersecurity Act Review

The European Commission launched a consultation on updating the EU Cybersecurity Act, including potential changes to ENISA's mandate. The consultation was open until June 20, 2025.

#### Privacy Enforcement

On June 30, 2025, Norway's data protection regulator (operating under EDPB framework) issued fines and reprimands for unlawful use of tracking pixels, underlining the intersection of privacy and cybersecurity concerns.

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Enhanced Coordination Mechanisms

- **EU-CyCLONe Activation:** Tested during simulated exercises in June
- **Cross-Border Intelligence Sharing:** Enhanced protocols for threat information exchange
- **Critical Infrastructure Protection:** Increased focus on energy, transport, and healthcare sectors

### Member State Actions

- **Cybersecurity Exercises:** Multiple member states conducted crisis response drills
- **National Implementation:** Continued work on transposing EU directives into national law
- **Public-Private Partnerships:** Increased collaboration with private sector on threat intelligence

## Statistics

### Incident Volume

- **Fewer large-scale breaches** compared to US and Asia
- **2.2 million individuals** affected by Ahold Delhaize disclosure
- **Thousands** of documents stolen in Scania breach
- **Multiple municipal services** disrupted by ransomware

### Regulatory Progress

- **13 out of 27** EU member states had not yet implemented NIS2 by late June
- **Nearly 200 pages** of ENISA security guidance published
- **5 severity levels** defined in new Cybersecurity Blueprint
- **5 crisis stages** established for incident response

### Sector Targeting

- **Luxury retail** increasingly targeted by Scattered Spider
- **Municipal governments** vulnerable to ransomware
- **Transportation** affected by supply chain attacks
- **Manufacturing** targeted for vendor credential theft

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Developments

- **Strong regulatory framework** advancing across EU
- **Unified crisis response** mechanisms established
- **Clear compliance expectations** provided by ENISA
- **Enhanced coordination** structures through EU-CyCLONe

### Ongoing Challenges

- **Implementation lag** in half of member states
- **Resource requirements** for comprehensive NIS2 compliance
- **Under-resourced municipal IT** vulnerable to attacks
- **Supply chain vulnerabilities** across sectors
- **State-sponsored threats** persistent against EU institutions

### Lessons Learned

- **Third-party risk management** critical for all sectors
- **Municipal cybersecurity** requires significant investment
- **Vendor credential protection** essential for supply chain security
- **Cross-border coordination** necessary for effective response

## Looking Ahead

The combination of the new Cybersecurity Blueprint and detailed NIS2 guidance positions the EU with one of the world's most comprehensive cybersecurity regulatory frameworks. However, effective implementation remains the key challenge:

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Accelerate NIS2 Implementation:** Member states must transpose directive into national law
2. **Compliance Investment:** Organizations need to allocate resources for security measures
3. **Municipal Hardening:** Local governments require cybersecurity upgrades and funding
4. **Supply Chain Security:** Enhanced vendor security requirements and monitoring

### Medium-Term Goals

1. **EU-CyCLONe Maturation:** Develop operational capability for cross-border crisis response
2. **Cyber Resilience Act:** Finalize and implement product security requirements
3. **Public Awareness:** Educate citizens and organizations about cyber threats
4. **International Cooperation:** Strengthen partnerships with NATO and global allies

### Strategic Vision

The EU's regulatory approach in mid-2025 reflects a trend toward tightening laws to improve digital resilience and hold organizations accountable for cyber risks. The events of June 2025 – from municipal ransomware to luxury brand breaches – demonstrate that while the framework is strong, continuous vigilance and investment remain necessary to address evolving threats.
