# Cybersecurity Incidents – June 2025

## Global Overview

### Trends & Analysis

June 2025 saw a wave of major cyber incidents worldwide, with billions of records and credentials exposed and hundreds of ransomware attacks reported. Notably, cybersecurity experts uncovered one of the largest data leaks in history, involving over 16 billion stolen login credentials compiled from infostealer malware on victim devices. This massive dump included usernames/passwords for popular services (Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.) and even government portals in 29+ countries, underscoring the global scale of data theft.

In China, researchers discovered a misconfigured database leaking 4 billion sensitive records – possibly the country's largest-ever breach – containing financial data and personal details from platforms like WeChat and Alipay.

Ransomware remained pervasive: according to one report, 463 ransomware victims were recorded globally in June (a 15% drop from May). The United States was the most targeted country (235 victims), far ahead of others like Canada, the UK and Germany. Attackers concentrated on industries with low downtime tolerance – the Professional Services sector alone saw 60 incidents, followed by Healthcare (52) and IT (50).

A new ransomware group "Qilin" emerged as the most active threat in June (81 victims), even exploiting unpatched Fortinet vulnerabilities, while other new strains (e.g. Fog, Anubis) introduced stealthier tactics. These trends highlight growing adversary sophistication and relentless targeting of critical data and infrastructure for extortion.

State-sponsored cyber operations continued in the background. For example, China-linked hackers (dubbed "Salt Typhoon") breached global telecom firm Viasat in June – gaining unauthorized access via a compromised device – though the attack was contained with no customer impact. Likewise, a targeted hack of The Washington Post's email system illustrated ongoing cyber-espionage threats to media and organizations, likely by nation-state actors.

Overall, the month's incidents exposed a broad threat landscape: from rampant cybercrime (mass credential dumps, ransomware in every region) to strategic breaches tied to geopolitical actors. The urgent need for resilience was underscored by widespread impacts – disrupted supply chains, millions of individuals' data stolen, and ever-evolving attacker techniques.

## Major Global Incidents

### June 2025 – 16 Billion Credentials Leaked

- **Attack Type:** Massive credential dump from infostealer malware
- **Impact:** 16+ billion stolen login credentials exposed
- **Attribution:** Compiled from infostealer malware on victim devices
- **Details:** Security researchers uncovered one of the largest data leaks in history, involving over 16 billion stolen login credentials. The dump included usernames and passwords for popular services including Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and government portals in more than 29 countries. This compilation represented years of credential theft via infostealer malware installed on victim devices worldwide.

### Early June 2025 – China's 4 Billion Record Leak

- **Attack Type:** Misconfigured database exposure
- **Impact:** 4 billion sensitive records exposed
- **Attribution:** Misconfiguration (no external hack)
- **Details:** In what may be the most extensive data breach in China's history, a stunning 4 billion sensitive records were publicly exposed due to a misconfigured database. The 631GB database included financial data, over 805 million WeChat user IDs, 780 million addresses, 630 million bank records with card numbers and personal details, and 577 million WeChat metadata entries. The database had no password protection and was publicly accessible. Discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko and the Cybernews team, the database was quickly taken down, but the exposure potentially impacts hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens.

### June 2025 – Viasat Breach

- **Attack Type:** State-sponsored intrusion
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access via compromised device; no customer impact
- **Attribution:** China-linked "Salt Typhoon" group
- **Details:** China-linked hackers dubbed "Salt Typhoon" breached global telecommunications firm Viasat in June. The attackers gained unauthorized access through a compromised device, though the attack was contained before causing customer impact.

## State-Sponsored Activities

### China-Linked Operations

- **Salt Typhoon:** Breached Viasat telecommunications infrastructure
- **APT Activity:** Continued targeting of Asian government networks (discovered in July)
- **Espionage:** Ongoing attempts against defense and research institutions globally

### Media Targeting

The Washington Post email hack (detailed in US section) demonstrated continued nation-state threats against media organizations, with attackers compromising journalist accounts to access sensitive source communications.

## Emerging Trends

### Credential Theft at Scale

The 16 billion credential leak represents a culmination of years of infostealer malware operations. These credentials enable:
- Account takeover attacks
- Business email compromise
- Lateral movement in corporate networks
- Social engineering campaigns

### Critical Infrastructure Targeting

Attacks on dams (Norway), utilities, and telecommunications continued, demonstrating adversary interest in:
- Testing capabilities against OT/ICS systems
- Gathering intelligence on critical infrastructure
- Demonstrating hybrid warfare capabilities

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Multiple incidents stemmed from third-party compromises:
- Vendor breaches exposing client data
- Exploited software vulnerabilities
- Compromised managed service providers

## International Response

While no major coordinated law enforcement action occurred in June specifically, governments worldwide:
- Enhanced threat intelligence sharing
- Issued advisories on ransomware threats
- Accelerated critical infrastructure protection initiatives
- Strengthened incident reporting requirements

## Statistics Summary
