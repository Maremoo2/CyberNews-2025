## Corporate Security Incidents

### Washington Post Email Hack

- **Date:** June 2025
- **Target:** The Washington Post (journalists' email accounts)
- **Attack Type:** Targeted cyber intrusion / email compromise
- **Impact:** Multiple reporter Microsoft Office 365 accounts compromised; sensitive communications exposed
- **Attribution:** Believed to be state-sponsored espionage (possible Chinese state hackers)
- **Details:** Journalists at The Washington Post fell victim to a targeted cyber intrusion in June. Attackers compromised the Post's Microsoft Office 365 email accounts for multiple reporters, gaining access to sensitive internal communications. The breach did not affect the newspaper's wider IT systems or subscriber data, but it potentially exposed confidential journalist-source communications. The attack is believed to be state-sponsored espionage, given its focus on reporters covering international affairs. U.S. officials suspect a foreign intelligence service (uncorroborated reports pointed toward Chinese state hackers, considering the timing and targets). The Post worked with Microsoft and federal agencies to secure accounts and alerted sources whose information might have been leaked.

### United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI)

- **Date:** June 9, 2025
- **Target:** United Natural Foods Inc. (major food distributor)
- **Attack Type:** Cyberattack (likely ransomware)
- **Impact:** Critical systems offline, distribution operations disrupted
- **Attribution:** Responsible group not publicly named

Order fulfillment was significantly hindered for several days, affecting supermarkets across the country. UNFI reported ongoing recovery efforts and fallback to manual processes. No evidence of customer data theft was immediately reported; the primary damage was business interruption. The incident illustrates the supply-chain ripple effect a cyberattack on a critical wholesaler can cause. UNFI's stock temporarily dipped as investors assessed the costs of remediation and potential ransom payments (not confirmed).

### Hawaiian Airlines Ransomware

- **Date:** Mid-June 2025
- **Target:** Hawaiian Airlines
- **Attack Type:** Cyber incident (ransomware suspected)
- **Impact:** Flight operations disrupted, back-end IT systems affected
- **Attribution:** Not disclosed
- **Details:** In mid-June, Hawaiian Airlines suffered a cyber incident that disrupted flight operations. While technical details were not fully disclosed, the attack affected back-end IT systems supporting flight scheduling and check-in. The disruption patterns suggested ransomware, and the airline proactively halted some services. No customer data loss was confirmed, but flights were delayed or rescheduled, and the FAA was notified as a precaution. Hawaiian Airlines engaged cybersecurity experts and federal authorities immediately. By late June, systems were restored from backups and normal operations resumed. This case showed that even if passenger data remains safe, cyberattacks on operational technology can seriously impact business continuity and spurred other airlines to review their incident response plans.
