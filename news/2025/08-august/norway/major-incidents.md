### Aug 13, 2025 (Announced) – Bremanger Dam Sabotage Attribution

- **Date:** Attack occurred April 7, 2025; formal attribution announced August 13, 2025
- **Target:** Bremanger hydroelectric dam (Western Norway)
- **Attack Type:** Critical infrastructure cyberattack - remote control system compromise
- **Impact:** Dam floodgate opened for 4 hours, 500 liters/second water release
- **Attribution:** Russian hackers (pro-Russian cybercriminal group)

#### Attribution Details

**PST Official Statement (August 13):**
Norway's intelligence service PST publicly attributed the April 2025 cyberattack on a Norwegian dam to Russian hackers. This marked the first time Norway formally blamed Russia for a cyber attack on its infrastructure.

**PST Chief Beate Gangås Statement:**
"Over the past year, we have seen a change in activity from pro-Russian cyber actors." The Bremanger incident was cited as a prime example of this new threat pattern.

**Attack Characteristics:**
- Attackers gained remote control of dam's gate controls
- Opened floodgate for four hours
- Released 500 liters of water per second
- Fortunately, no flooding damage occurred (water levels were low)
- Intent: to sow fear and chaos among Norwegian population

**Evidence:**
- Norwegian police noted the attack was likely carried out by a pro-Russian cybercriminal group
- Group posted video of the incident on Telegram
- Video was watermarked with name of pro-Russian cybercriminal group
- Investigation combined technical forensics with open-source intelligence

**Geopolitical Context:**
- Attributed as part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy
- Aim to influence and cause fear among general population
- Demonstrate capability to disrupt critical infrastructure
- Intimidate Norway for support of Ukraine

**Norwegian Response:**
- First official attribution of cyber attack to Russia by Norway
- Raised threat level for critical infrastructure
- Enhanced monitoring of hydroelectric facilities and other infrastructure
- Increased cooperation with NATO allies on cyber defense

### National Security Warnings

**PST Chief's Annual Forum Speech (Mid-August, Arendalsuka):**

At Norway's annual Arendalsuka forum in mid-August, PST Chief Beate Gangås issued stark warnings about cyber threats:

**Key Messages:**
- "Our Russian neighbor has become more dangerous" in cyberspace
- Norway observed spike in hostile cyber activity over past year
- Targeting of energy, finance, and government sectors
- Bremanger dam hack cited as prime example
- Similar operations aim to intimidate Norwegian population
- Pressure Oslo's support for Ukraine

**Threat Assessment:**
- Increased reconnaissance on Norwegian critical infrastructure
- Pro-Russian actors exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities
- Mix of state-sponsored and cybercriminal actors
- Hybrid warfare tactics combining cyber and traditional threats

**Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) Response:**

**Enhanced Monitoring:**
- Real-time monitoring of undersea internet cables
- Oil and gas pipeline security increased
- Hydroelectric facilities prioritized
- Power grid infrastructure assessment

**Industry Advisories:**
- Issued advisories to key industries
- Guidance on bolstering incident response plans
- Emphasis on supply chain security
- Board-level cybersecurity responsibility

**NATO Coordination:**
- Norway joined NATO allies in coordinated cyber exercises during August

### Other Similar Attacks Under Investigation

**Second Similar Incident:**
Norwegian authorities (Kripos) indicated another similar hacker attack was under investigation in mid-2025, though details were not made public for operational security reasons. The incident had similar characteristics to the Bremanger dam attack.

**Ongoing Low-Grade Activity:**
- Denial-of-service attacks on public and private websites
- Attempted intrusions into ministry networks
- Reconnaissance on critical infrastructure
- None causing major damage but contributing to elevated threat level

## Norwegian Company Breaches

**No major corporate breaches publicly disclosed in August 2025**

However, officials cautioned that absence of disclosure does not mean absence of incidents:

### Supply Chain Concerns

**PST Assessment:**
The head of PST noted that several data breaches and IT supply-chain attacks in Norway over the past year have been linked to pro-Russian actors exploiting smaller suppliers.

**Key Points:**
- April dam attack enabled by weak controls at subcontractor
- Supply chain represents major vulnerability
- Many incidents not publicly disclosed
- Smaller vendors often have weaker security

**Industry Warning:**
Norwegian companies were urged to:
- Treat cybersecurity as board-level responsibility
- Scrutinize vendor relationships and security
- Implement supply chain risk management
- Conduct security audits of critical suppliers

**Expert Assessment:**
Industry experts warned that the next major cyber incident in Norway will "almost certainly originate in the supply chain" if organizations don't shore up third-party risk management.

### Previous Context (Reference)

**Norsk Hydro 2019:**
While not an August incident, the 2019 Norsk Hydro ransomware attack remains a reference point for Norwegian cyber resilience. The company's transparent handling and recovery became a model for incident response.

**Recent Developments:**
Norwegian companies that suffered previous attacks (like Hydro) have invested significantly in cybersecurity, often becoming more mature than peers. However, many Norwegian SMEs and government entities remain vulnerable.
