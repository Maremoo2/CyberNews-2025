- **Target:** DaVita Inc. (Healthcare/dialysis provider)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware/Data Breach
- **Impact:** ~2.6–2.7 million patients affected; over 1TB of data exfiltrated

- **Details:** Healthcare giant DaVita (dialysis clinics) disclosed a major breach affecting ~2.6–2.7 million patients. The InterLock ransomware group infiltrated DaVita's servers (between March and April 2025), exfiltrating over 1TB of data including patient names, Social Security numbers, insurance info, medical records (dialysis details), and even scanned checks. In August, DaVita confirmed the incident and began notifying patients and regulators, as the attackers leaked some data to pressure the company. This breach highlighted continued targeting of healthcare organizations for their valuable patient data and the extended dwell time attackers maintained before discovery.

The breach was attributed to the ShinyHunters extortion group, as part of its multi-company campaign abusing Salesforce integrations.

Farmers disclosed the incident in August, cooperating with law enforcement and offering identity protection services to those affected.

### Aug 28, 2025 – TransUnion

- **Date:** August 28, 2025 (disclosure; attack occurred late July)
- **Target:** TransUnion (Credit bureau)
- **Attack Type:** Data Breach via third-party customer support platform
- **Impact:** ~4.4 million individuals affected
- **Attribution:** ShinyHunters campaign (Salesforce-related)
- **Details:** Credit bureau TransUnion confirmed a breach impacting ~4.4 million individuals.

Compromised data included consumers' names, phone numbers, email addresses, billing addresses, dates of birth, and full unredacted Social Security numbers. No financial accounts were directly accessed. TransUnion notified regulators and affected Americans, and the FTC opened an inquiry given the sensitivity of the data. This breach raised serious concerns about credit bureau security and the protection of highly sensitive consumer financial information.

### Aug 8, 2025 – U.S. Federal Judiciary

- **Date:** August 8, 2025 (disclosure; attack occurred early July)
- **Target:** U.S. Federal Courts' case management system (PACER/CM-ECF)
- **Attack Type:** Government data breach/espionage
- **Impact:** Sealed court records potentially exposed, including confidential informant identities
- **Attribution:** Suspected nation-state cyber-espionage operation
- **Details:** The U.S. Federal Courts' case management system (PACER/CM-ECF) was breached, potentially exposing sealed court records. Officials disclosed in August that in early July hackers accessed sensitive judicial filings – including confidential informant identities and sealed legal documents – across multiple federal districts. The incident prompted an urgent security overhaul: stricter access controls, multi-factor authentication, and network monitoring were implemented for court systems. While no perpetrator was publicly identified, investigators suspected a nation-state cyber-espionage operation given the nature of the data. This unprecedented breach of the federal judiciary raised concerns about the security of sensitive legal proceedings.

## Corporate Security Incidents

### Aug 5, 2025 – SonicWall VPN Exploits: Ransomware Campaign

- **Date:** Started mid-July, peaked early August 2025
- **Target:** Companies using SonicWall VPN devices
- **Attack Type:** VPN vulnerability exploitation for ransomware deployment
- **Impact:** Multiple organizations breached including Hitachi Vantara, Nissan Australia, Stanford University
- **Attribution:** Akira ransomware affiliates
- **Details:** A widespread campaign by Akira ransomware affiliates targeted companies using SonicWall VPN devices. Starting in mid-July and peaking in early August, attackers leveraged a SonicWall Gen7 SSL-VPN vulnerability (initially feared a zero-day, later identified as CVE-2024-40766) to breach organizations even if MFA was enabled. Victims included Hitachi Vantara, Nissan Australia, and Stanford University, among others. Once in, the Akira gang deployed ransomware on networks, forcing companies offline. SonicWall urgently urged all customers to take firewalls offline or patch. This incident highlighted the danger of unpatched VPN appliances and prompted a DHS/CISA alert about securing remote access infrastructure.

### Aug 18, 2025 – Workday

- **Date:** August 18, 2025 (early August attack)
- **Target:** Workday (HR software provider)
- **Attack Type:** Social engineering breach targeting third-party platform
- **Impact:** Business contacts database compromised; names, phone numbers, email addresses stolen
- **Attribution:** ShinyHunters campaign (suspected)
- **Details:** HR software provider Workday revealed it was hit by a social engineering attack targeting a third-party customer management platform. In early August, attackers impersonating employees tricked a support partner and accessed a Workday database of business contacts – stealing names, phone numbers, and email addresses of customers. No core Workday systems or client data were compromised. The breach appeared to be part of the ShinyHunters' Salesforce-related assault on tech firms. Workday enhanced its vendor access controls and urged customers to be alert for phishing. This incident demonstrated how even well-secured companies can be vulnerable through third-party relationships.

This incident, though limited in impact, underscored that even smaller-cap companies in entertainment and tech are under threat. Bragg engaged cybersecurity consultants and law enforcement to investigate how the attackers breached its defenses.

### Aug 24, 2025 – State of Nevada Ransomware Attack

- **Date:** August 24, 2025
- **Target:** State of Nevada government systems
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware attack
- **Impact:** First-ever statewide ransomware attack in U.S.; essential services disrupted
- **Attribution:** Not publicly claimed as of August (investigation ongoing)
- **Details:** August saw a first-of-a-kind attack on the State of Nevada. While hundreds of US government organizations have suffered ransomware attacks, this is the first-ever statewide attack. The attack was first detected on August 24, 2025, and has left many citizens and state agencies without access to essential services. No hackers had claimed the attack as of late August, but if a ransom isn't paid, it's likely the group will come forward in the coming days/weeks. Federal DHS/CISA teams provided on-site support. This incident underscored the need for robust cyber incident response at the state level and highlighted vulnerabilities in state government IT infrastructure.
