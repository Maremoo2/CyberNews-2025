### Sept 15, 2025 – FinWise Bank / American First Finance

- **Date:** September 15, 2025 (public disclosure; breach discovered earlier in 2025)
- **Target:** FinWise Bank (Utah-based) / American First Finance customers
- **Attack Type:** Insider breach (rogue former employee)
- **Impact:** ~689,000 American First Finance customers affected
- **Attribution:** Former employee of FinWise
- **Details:** FinWise Bank (Utah-based) revealed that an insider incident had exposed data of approximately 689,000 customers of American First Finance (AFF). In this case, a rogue former employee of FinWise unlawfully accessed systems and leaked personal data (names, contact info, and other identifiers) of AFF's loan customers. The breach, actually discovered earlier in 2025, became public in September, prompting investigations and class-action lawsuits. FinWise offered 12 months of free credit monitoring to those affected. This insider breach highlighted the human factor risk in cybersecurity and the critical importance of proper access controls, particularly for former employees. The incident raised questions about internal monitoring systems and the time lag between breach occurrence and public disclosure.

### Sept 26, 2025 – Union County, Ohio

- **Date:** September 26, 2025
- **Target:** Union County government (Ohio)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware
- **Impact:** Over 45,000 residents and employees affected
- **Attribution:** No ransomware group claimed credit initially

The county reported no evidence (yet) of the data being leaked or sold, and no ransomware group took credit immediately. This attack on a local U.S. government highlights the continued targeting of municipalities with limited cybersecurity resources. In its aftermath, neighboring counties and states reviewed their cyber defenses, and the incident was cited in calls for more federal cybersecurity grants at the local level. The breach affected critical county services including health and human services records, property records, and employee information.

- **Details:** Insight Partners, a New York-based venture capital firm, warned thousands of individuals in September that their data was compromised in a ransomware attack. The attack (attributed to unknown actors) actually occurred in January, involving a social engineering entry. Attackers stole sensitive info including banking/tax details of employees, and data on limited partners and portfolio companies. Approximately 12,657 people were affected. As of September, no ransomware group had claimed the attack, but Insight's disclosure shows the long tail of breaches (taking months to come to light). The 8-month delay between attack and public disclosure raised questions about breach detection capabilities and notification timelines in the financial services sector.

#### Workiva
- **Date:** September 18, 2025 (early August attack)
- **Target:** Workiva (SaaS firm providing financial reporting software)

In early August, attackers impersonating employees tricked a support partner and accessed a Workiva database of business contacts – stealing names, phone numbers, and email addresses of customers. No core Workiva systems or client data were compromised. The breach appeared to be part of the ShinyHunters' Salesforce-related assault on tech firms. Workiva enhanced its vendor access controls and urged customers to be alert for phishing.

### Sept (Approval) – St. Joseph, MO Municipal IT Upgrade

- **Date:** September 2025 (funding approval)
- **Context:** Response to spring 2025 cyberattack
- **Target:** St. Joseph, Missouri (population ~77,000)
- **Investment:** Over $1 million in cybersecurity upgrades
- **Funding Allocation:**
  - New firewalls
  - Network monitoring systems
  - Incident response planning
- **Details:** A noteworthy follow-up to a prior cyber incident: St. Joseph, Missouri approved over $1 million in cybersecurity upgrades in September as a direct response to a spring 2025 attack that crippled city IT systems. This story, while not a fresh breach, highlights how smaller U.S. cities are investing heavily to modernize aging systems after being caught off-guard. The funding is going toward new firewalls, network monitoring, and incident response planning. It serves as a cautionary tale that cyber incidents can impose not just immediate recovery costs but also long-term expenses to improve resilience. The case study demonstrates the financial burden cyberattacks place on small municipalities with limited budgets.
