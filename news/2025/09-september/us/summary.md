# September 2025 - United States Summary

## Overview

In the United States, September 2025 saw a mix of significant corporate breaches, government cybersecurity actions, and policy developments. Several major data breaches hit American companies – from casinos to investment firms – compromising personal information. The federal government grappled with maintaining cybersecurity programs amid legislative hurdles, as a key cyber law expired during a budget impasse. Nonetheless, agencies like the DoD advanced new cybersecurity frameworks, and law enforcement scored wins against cybercriminal infrastructure. Meanwhile, high-profile ransomware attacks affected U.S. local governments and businesses, underscoring persistent threats.

The expiration of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015 on October 1, 2025 represented a significant setback for public-private cyber threat intelligence sharing. Experts warned that voluntary information sharing could drop by as much as 80% without the law's liability protections. However, the Department of Defense's introduction of the Cybersecurity Risk Management Construct (CRMC) marked a transformative shift toward continuous monitoring and dynamic risk assessment, signaling progress in federal cybersecurity modernization.

## Key Trends

### The ShinyHunters Salesforce Campaign

Multiple U.S.-based tech companies fell victim to a supply-chain data breach via compromised OAuth tokens from the Salesloft/Drift incident:

**Major U.S. Victims:**
- **Cloudflare:** Intruders accessed Salesforce data including customer API tokens and credentials
- **Palo Alto Networks:** Attackers leveraged third-party tokens to breach support system and steal customer support case data
- **Workiva:** Breach of business contact info and support tickets
- All incidents traced to ShinyHunters group's Salesforce partner token hack

**Attack Methodology:**
- Social engineering and OAuth token abuse
- Voice-phishing (vishing) targeting vendor support staff
- Exploitation of trusted third-party CRM integrations
- Coordinated campaign across multiple companies

**Impact:**
- Demonstrated cascading effects of single supply-chain compromise
- FBI and CISA issued alerts to other Salesforce customers
- Renewed focus on OAuth token management and API security
- Questions raised about third-party vendor security oversight

### Healthcare Sector Vulnerabilities

Healthcare organizations remained prime targets despite regulatory oversight:

**Characteristics:**
- High value of personal health information (PHI)
- Extended dwell times before detection
- Sensitive data including Social Security numbers and medical records
- Regulatory compliance challenges (HIPAA)

**Notable Incidents:**
- Insider threat at FinWise Bank exposing 689,000 customers
- Multiple healthcare providers dealing with legacy system vulnerabilities
- Continued targeting despite potential for patient care disruption

### Local Government Under Siege

**Union County, Ohio (Sept 26):**
- Ransomware hit county government systems
- Over 45,000 residents and employees affected
- Data included Social Security numbers, financial records, medical data
- No immediate evidence of data leak or sale
- No ransomware group claimed credit initially
- Prompted neighboring counties to review cyber defenses
- Cited in calls for more federal cybersecurity grants to local governments

**Broader Trend:**
- Local governments lack resources for robust cybersecurity
- Critical services and resident data at risk
- Federal support needed for municipal cyber defense
- At least 9 U.S. states had local government ransomware attacks in 2025

### Insider Threats and Social Engineering

**FinWise Bank Insider Incident (Sept 15):**
- Rogue former employee unlawfully accessed systems
- Exposed data of ~689,000 American First Finance customers
- Data included full names and personal identifiers
- Breach discovered earlier in 2025, became public in September
- Class-action lawsuits filed
- 12 months free credit monitoring offered
- Highlighted human factor risk in cybersecurity

**Key Lessons:**
- Insider threats remain significant vulnerability
- Access controls and monitoring essential
- Former employee access must be promptly revoked
- Background checks and security awareness critical

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Expiration of a Key Cyber Law

On October 1, 2025 (just after the fiscal year-end), the **Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015** officially expired when U.S. Congress failed to renew it in time. This law had provided legal protections for companies to share threat data with the government and each other. Its lapse, caused amid a federal government shutdown standoff, raised concerns that voluntary cyber threat sharing could drop sharply – by up to 80%, according to some experts.

**Key Impacts:**
- **Legal Protections Lost:** Companies previously shielded from lawsuits for sharing relevant, non-private threat data in good faith
- **Liability Concerns:** Without critical protection for legal privileges and liability/antitrust protections, private entities became less likely to voluntarily share information
- **Reduced Visibility:** The U.S. may face reduced visibility into emerging cyber threats during the lapse
- **DHS Response:** Department of Homeland Security vowed to continue operating information-sharing programs during the lapse
- **Attorney Warnings:** Security attorneys from WilmerHale warned firms might hold back due to perceived increased risk
- **Bipartisan Efforts:** The law's expiration immediately sparked bipartisan efforts to draft a reauthorization

**Significance:**
The expiration occurred during a critical period of heightened cyber threats, potentially hampering the government's ability to coordinate national cyber defense when it's needed most.

### DoD's New Cyber Risk Framework

In September 2025, the Department of Defense introduced a major overhaul to its cybersecurity risk management approach:

**Cybersecurity Risk Management Construct (CRMC):**
- **Launch Date:** September 2025
- **Purpose:** Long-awaited replacement for DoD's outdated, paperwork-heavy Risk Management Framework
- **Key Innovation:** Adopts "continuous Authority to Operate" (cATO) model
- **Methodology:** Real-time monitoring and ongoing risk assessment rather than periodic compliance checkboxes
- **Facilitation:** Supported by SWFT initiative for DevSecOps
- **Benefits:**
  - Speeds up secure software deployments to warfighters
  - Shifts from static compliance documentation to dynamic, data-driven assurance
  - Aligns with modern software delivery pace
  - Enables near-real-time monitoring and risk response

**Significance:**
This shift is seen as transformative, bringing DoD cybersecurity into a more proactive stance. It aligns with the broader U.S. strategy of moving from static compliance to continuous validation and reflects the evolution of cyber threats requiring adaptive, real-time defenses.
