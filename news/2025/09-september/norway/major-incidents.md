# September 2025 - Norway Major Incidents

## National Cyber Incidents

### No Major New Attacks in September 2025

Norway did not experience any publicly disclosed major cyberattacks in September 2025. This represents a relatively calm period compared to earlier months in the year and contrasts with significant incidents affecting other European nations during the same timeframe.

**Significance of the Absence:**
- First month without major incident since April 2025 dam attack
- Demonstrates effectiveness of enhanced security measures
- Shows value of preparation and vigilance
- Provides opportunity for strategic improvements
- However, does not indicate absence of threats

**Minor Incidents:**
While no major attacks occurred, Norway experienced routine cyber activity:
- Phishing attempts targeting government ministries
- Low-level DDoS attacks on public websites
- Brief disruptions to bank login portals (early September)
- All mitigated without significant impact
- Attributed to improved preparedness and response capabilities

## Context: Earlier Critical Infrastructure Attack

### April 2025 – Lake Risevatnet Dam Sabotage

**Background Context for September:**

- **Date of Attack:** April 2025
- **Target:** Lake Risevatnet hydroelectric dam (Bremanger, Norway)
- **Attack Type:** Sabotage of industrial control systems
- **Impact:** Brief increase in water discharge (controlled flood)
- **Attribution Date:** August 2025
- **Attribution:** Russian state-sponsored hackers (announced by PST)
- **Significance:** Norway's first formal attribution of cyber attack to Russia

**Relevance to September 2025:**

The dam incident, disclosed in August, remained fresh in September's discourse and influenced Norway's cybersecurity posture throughout the month:

1. **Heightened Infrastructure Monitoring:**
   - Increased surveillance of hydroelectric facilities
   - Enhanced monitoring of energy sector control systems
   - Water system security reviews accelerated
   - Real-time threat detection improvements

2. **Political Implications:**
   - Demonstrated Russian willingness to attack physical infrastructure
   - Confirmed Norway as target due to Ukraine support
   - Validated warnings about hybrid warfare tactics
   - Justified increased cybersecurity investments

3. **Defense Posture Adjustments:**
   - Critical infrastructure sectors on high alert through September
   - Emergency response protocols tested and refined
   - Coordination between NSM and sector operators strengthened
   - Incident response capabilities enhanced

## Threat Environment in September

### Ongoing Russian Cyber Threat

**Police Security Service (PST) Assessment:**

Throughout September, Norwegian security officials maintained warnings about the evolving Russian cyber threat:

**Threat Characteristics:**
- Shift from opportunistic to strategic targeting
- Focus on reconnaissance of critical infrastructure
- Combination of state actors and pro-Russian cybercriminals
- Hybrid warfare approach supporting geopolitical objectives
- Persistent probing of energy, finance, and government sectors

**Attack Patterns Observed:**
- Supply chain exploitation as primary vector
- Long-term persistence in compromised networks
- Combination of espionage, sabotage, and influence operations
- Coordination with broader geopolitical pressure campaigns

### Pro-Russian Hacktivist Activity

**DDoS Campaigns (Early September):**
- **Targets:** Norwegian public websites, bank login portals
- **Attribution:** Pro-Russian hacktivist groups
- **Impact:** Minimal – brief disruptions only
- **Response:** Mitigated through enhanced DDoS protection
- **Assessment:** Nuisance level rather than serious threats
- **Significance:** Demonstrated ongoing hostile activity despite no major breaches

**Characteristics:**
- Low sophistication compared to state-sponsored operations
- Politically motivated (response to Norway's Ukraine support)
- Limited technical capabilities
- Quickly detected and mitigated
- Part of broader pattern across NATO countries

## Norwegian Company Security Posture

### No Public Breach Disclosures

**Notable Absence:**
No major Norwegian companies reported data breaches or significant cyber incidents in September 2025. This contrasts with:
- UK: Jaguar Land Rover, Harrods, Kido International
- Japan: Asahi Breweries
- France: Multiple telecom and retail breaches
- US: Multiple corporate and government breaches

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Improved Defenses:**
   - Learning from past incidents (2019 Norsk Hydro, 2022 NORCERT)
   - Investment in cybersecurity following earlier attacks
   - Enhanced threat detection and response
   - Better supply chain security practices

2. **Strong Preparedness:**
   - Regular security drills and exercises
   - Proactive threat hunting
   - Effective information sharing between companies and authorities
   - NSM guidance and support

3. **Smaller Attack Surface:**
   - Norwegian companies may be less attractive targets than larger European or US firms
   - Strong privacy and security culture
   - Regulatory compliance driving security improvements
   - Limited data on high-value targets

4. **Possible Underreporting:**
   - Some incidents may not have been publicly disclosed
   - Companies may have contained incidents without public knowledge
   - Disclosure timelines vary (some breaches announced months later)

### Industry Preparedness Activities

## Key Takeaways

**September 2025 in Norway was characterized by:**

1. **No Major Incidents:** First calm month since April dam attack
2. **Continued Vigilance:** Minor threats mitigated effectively
3. **Regulatory Progress:** EU alignment and NIS2 preparation
4. **International Cooperation:** Active participation in collective defense
5. **Sector Preparedness:** Proactive drills and security improvements
6. **Strategic Positioning:** Leveraging calm period for strengthening defenses

**Lessons from September:**

* **Preparedness Pays Off:** Investment in security yielded results
* **Vigilance Required:** Absence of attacks doesn't mean absence of threats
* **Collective Defense:** International cooperation enhances national security
* **Regulatory Alignment:** EU frameworks provide strong foundation
* **Sector Cooperation:** Public-private partnerships work effectively
* **Continuous Improvement:** Using calm periods to prepare for future threats

**Looking Ahead:**

The relative calm of September 2025 provided Norway with an opportunity to:
- Implement lessons learned from April dam attack
- Prepare for upcoming regulatory requirements (NIS2, CRA)
- Strengthen critical infrastructure defenses
- Enhance international cooperation frameworks
- Train workforce and raise awareness
- Test and refine incident response capabilities

However, security officials emphasized that this calm should not lead to complacency. The ongoing threat from Russian state-sponsored actors, coupled with the general increase in cybercrime globally, means Norway must maintain its heightened security posture into the winter of 2025 and beyond.

## Recommendations for Norwegian Organizations

Based on September 2025 experience, security experts recommend:

* **Maintain current security posture** despite absence of major incidents
* **Complete NIS2 compliance preparations** ahead of enforcement
* **Conduct regular security drills** particularly for critical infrastructure
* **Enhance supply chain security** as identified primary vulnerability
* **Participate in threat intelligence sharing** through NSM and sector groups
* **Invest in digital skills training** for all employees
* **Prepare for CRA requirements** if providing digital products/services
* **Test incident response plans** through tabletop exercises
* **Monitor international threat landscape** for tactics used against Nordic countries
* **Support collective defense initiatives** like Tallinn Mechanism

The message from Norwegian authorities in September was clear: use this period of relative calm to prepare, not to relax. The threats remain real, and the next attack could come at any time.
