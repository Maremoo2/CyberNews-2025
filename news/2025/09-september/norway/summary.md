# September 2025 - Norway Summary

## Overview

In Norway, September 2025 was relatively calm in terms of new cyber incidents, but the country remained vigilant due to earlier attacks on its critical infrastructure and ongoing geopolitical threats. While no major breaches were publicly disclosed in Norway during the month, cybersecurity was in focus through government initiatives and defense sector developments. Norway, as a leading digital nation in Europe, continued aligning with EU cybersecurity regulations and investing in protecting its vital sectors (energy, maritime, etc.).

The absence of major incidents provided an opportunity for Norway to focus on strengthening defenses, implementing new regulations, and preparing for future threats. However, officials cautioned that attempted intrusions occur constantly under the radar, and the relative quiet should not breed complacency. The context of earlier attacks, particularly the April 2025 dam sabotage attributed to Russia, remained fresh in national security discourse throughout September.

## Key Developments

### No Major New Attacks Reported

Unlike some prior months, Norway did not suffer a significant cyberattack in September 2025 that reached public attention. There were no crippling ransomware incidents or large data breaches disclosed by Norwegian companies or government agencies during this period. This relative quiet is notable given the heightened threat environment in Europe.

**Context of Vigilance:**
- Officials cautioned attempted intrusions occur constantly
- Minor phishing and DDoS events hit various ministries and firms
- These were mitigated without serious damage (often thanks to improved preparedness)
- Relative quiet should not breed complacency

### Context – Earlier Infrastructure Attack

**April 2025 Lake Risevatnet Dam Incident:**
- Attackers sabotaged Norwegian hydroelectric dam's controls
- Briefly increased water discharge in controlled flood
- August 2025: Norway's intelligence service attributed attack to Russian state-sponsored hackers
- Fresh in September's discourse as reminder of infrastructure vulnerability

**Prior Incidents Informing September Posture:**
- 2023 ministry IT platform breach
- Ongoing probing of energy and water systems
- Police Security Service (PST) warnings about Russia and other actors
- Pattern of testing Norway's critical infrastructure defenses

### Heightened Threat Posture

**National Cyber Security Centre (NSM) Status:**
- No specific incident advisories issued in September
- Maintained "yellow" alert level
- Reason: Ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and related cyber threats

**Background Threat Activity:**
- Steady background of cyber activity targeting Norway
- Frequent but low-level DDoS attacks by pro-Russian hacktivists
- Targeted Norwegian public websites
- Some occurred in early September, briefly affecting bank login portals
- Minimal impact beyond nuisance level

**Official Assessment:**
- Norway cannot be complacent
- Lull in major incidents likely temporary
- Critical sectors must remain prepared
- Continuous adaptation needed against evolving threats

## Norwegian Company Incidents

### No Significant Breach in September

No major Norwegian companies reported data breaches in September 2025. In recent years, Norway has seen incidents (for instance, the 2022 attack on NORCERT, or the 2019 Norsk Hydro ransomware case), but the month in question had no public disclosures of a comparable scale. It appears Norwegian organizations avoided the fate of those in other countries (like the UK's JLR or Japan's Asahi) this month. This could be partly due to improved cyber defenses – many Norwegian firms have hardened their systems following earlier wake-up calls.

### Industry Vigilance

Despite lack of incidents, key Norwegian industries remained proactive:

**Oil & Gas Sector:**
- Performed emergency response drills in September
- Simulated cyber incidents on offshore platforms
- Enhanced monitoring and detection systems
- Supply chain security reviews

**Shipping/Maritime Industry:**
- Recognized as prime target in threat analyses
- Nordic Maritime Cyber Resilience Center (Norma Cyber) programs ongoing
- By September: Norma Cyber tracked 239 disruptive cyber incidents in global shipping
- Actively warned Norwegian shipping firms about:
  - Attempted GPS spoofing
  - Ransomware on port IT systems
  - Vulnerabilities in ship control systems

**Financial Sector:**
- Low-level DDoS attacks briefly affected bank login portals (early September)
- Enhanced resilience prevented significant disruptions
- Continued hardening of customer-facing systems
- Threat intelligence sharing with authorities

**Key Message:**
While Norwegian companies did not suffer a headline breach in September, they stayed on guard, recognizing that their luck might not hold forever without constant diligence.

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Alignment with EU Rules

**EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Integration:**
- Norway integrating CRA into draft national law (ahead of enforcement timeline)
- EEA membership requires alignment with EU cybersecurity regulations

## Conclusion

Norway's cybersecurity news in September 2025 was less about reacting to incidents and more about strengthening defenses and aligning with international standards. The relative lull in attacks provided an opportunity for Norway to refine its cyber strategies. However, reminders of lurking threats – from Russian saboteurs to ransomware crews – ensured that Norway did not let its guard down, continuing to invest in resilience for the critical winter ahead.

The month demonstrated Norway's mature approach to cybersecurity: using periods of relative calm to prepare for inevitable future challenges, learning from past incidents, and actively contributing to collective defense efforts while maintaining high standards for its critical sectors. The combination of no major incidents but continued vigilance and improvement represents an ideal cybersecurity posture – preventing attacks through preparation rather than responding to breaches after they occur.
