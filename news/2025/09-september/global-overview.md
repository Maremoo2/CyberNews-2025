# Cybersecurity Incidents – September 2025

## Global Overview

### Trends & Analysis

September 2025 was one of the most turbulent months in cybersecurity, with record-high ransomware, supply chain attacks, and data breaches reported worldwide. Critical infrastructure and industries faced major disruptions: for example, a ransomware attack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) forced multi-week factory shutdowns across the UK, Slovakia, India, and Brazil. The slow recovery even prompted the UK government to underwrite a $2 billion loan guarantee to help JLR resume operations. Meanwhile, a cyber attack on aviation IT provider Collins Aerospace halted airline check-ins across multiple countries (including major European airports) on the weekend of Sept 19, underscoring cross-border supply-chain risk. Authorities later arrested a suspect and confirmed the HardBit ransomware was used in the airport attack.

### September 19, 2025 – Collins Aerospace Ransomware Attack (vMUSE)

- **Attack Type:** Ransomware attack on critical aviation infrastructure
- **Impact:** Major European airport disruptions; thousands of passengers affected with manual check-in processing
- **Attribution:** HardBit ransomware group (confirmed by authorities)
- **Details:** A ransomware attack on Collins Aerospace's vMUSE check-in software paralyzed flight operations at major European airports including Heathrow, Brussels, Berlin, and Dublin. The shared check-in/boarding platform went offline, forcing thousands of passengers to be processed manually and causing widespread delays and flight cancellations. Collins Aerospace (owned by RTX Corp) confirmed the "cyber-related disruption" and worked with security agencies. The EU's cybersecurity agency confirmed it was a ransomware incident. This attack demonstrated how a single vendor compromise can cascade through multiple countries and businesses, having international ripple effects on global travel.

### September 2025 – Rising Attack Volumes & Costs

The onslaught of cyber incidents continued to grow in scale. Cloudflare observed the largest DDoS attack ever recorded in late September, peaking at 22.2 Tbps (twice the previous record from early September). In the public sector, Panama's Ministry of Economy and Finance suffered a ransomware breach stealing 1.5 terabytes of sensitive data. A German industry survey quantified the economic toll: cyberattacks over the past year cost the German economy ~€300 billion (≃$352 billion), nearly double the previous year's figure. These trends illustrate that no region or sector was spared in September's global cybercrime wave.

### Supply Chain Compromises

Threat actors increasingly targeted software supply chains and third-party services. Notably, the ShinyHunters extortion group exploited stolen OAuth tokens from Salesforce add-ons (Salesloft/Drift) to breach dozens of companies' CRM data. Victims included tech firms like Zscaler (exposed customer contact info and support cases), Palo Alto Networks (compromised Salesforce data), Cloudflare (support data and APIs leaked, attributed to ShinyHunters), and even automaker Stellantis (internal emails and personal data of employees/dealers via the same OAuth hack). 

Similarly, open-source ecosystems were hit by unprecedented attacks: the "Shai-Hulud" worm infected hundreds of npm packages to steal cloud credentials and propagate itself, and hackers hijacked a popular npm maintainer's account to inject malware into libraries with billions of downloads – disrupting an estimated 10% of all cloud environments.

### Evolving Tactics (AI & Espionage)

Security reports this month highlighted the weaponization of AI by cybercriminals. Attackers are leveraging large language models to automate phishing, malware development, and even extortion demands. For instance, an Anthropic study revealed cases where criminals used AI chatbots to steal data and generate convincing ransom notes. 

State-aligned espionage also remained active – e.g. a new China-linked hacker group ("Phantom Taurus") was identified deploying stealth malware against government targets in East Asia. Additionally, North Korean operatives were caught using AI-generated résumés to secure IT jobs abroad (a tactic to fund illicit activities). These developments show how attackers are innovating, forcing defenders worldwide to respond with more proactive and "zero-trust" strategies.

## Statistics (September 2025 Cyber Incidents)

### Key Metrics

**Record-Breaking DDoS Attack:**
- Peak: 22.2 terabits per second (Tbps)
- Duration: 40 seconds
- Previous record: 11.5 Tbps (early September)
- Source: Cloudflare

**Economic Impact:**
- German economy losses: €300 billion (~$352 billion)
- 34% of German firms suffered ransomware attacks
- Up from 12% in 2022

**Major Data Thefts:**
- Panama Ministry: 1.5 terabytes of sensitive data
- Vietnam Credit Bureau: 160 million records
- Multiple Fortune 500 companies via Salesforce OAuth breach

### Major Attack Types

**Ransomware:**
- Jaguar Land Rover: Multi-week factory shutdowns across 4 countries
- Collins Aerospace: Major European airport disruptions
- Kido International: 8,000+ children's records stolen

**Supply Chain:**
- ShinyHunters Salesforce campaign: Dozens of companies affected
- Shai-Hulud npm worm: Hundreds of packages infected
- npm maintainer account hijack: 2.6 billion weekly downloads affected

**State-Sponsored:**
- Phantom Taurus (China-linked): Government targets in East Asia
- North Korean IT workers: AI-generated fake résumés
- Chinese backdoors: Continued infrastructure targeting

## Key Recommendations

Based on September 2025's incidents, security experts emphasize:

* **Supply chain security and vendor due diligence** are critical to preventing third-party breaches
* **OAuth token management and API security** must be strengthened after Salesforce campaign
* **Critical infrastructure monitoring** is essential given aviation and automotive disruptions
* **Software supply chain protection** needed to prevent npm-style attacks
* **AI security awareness** required as attackers weaponize LLMs
* **Zero-trust architecture** adoption to counter evolving threat tactics
* **Incident response planning** for extended outages (JLR took 4 weeks to recover)
