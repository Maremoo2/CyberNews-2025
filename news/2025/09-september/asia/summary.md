# September 2025 - Asia Summary

## Overview

Across the Asia-Pacific region, September 2025 was marked by state-sponsored cyber espionage, massive data breaches, and emerging threat trends. Several countries in Asia experienced significant incidents – from a record-breaking breach in Vietnam to disruptive attacks on Japanese industry. Meanwhile, regional adversaries (particularly China and North Korea) continued to engage in cyber operations, prompting defensive moves by Asian governments. Key themes included attacks on national databases, threats to financial systems, and a rise in malware targeting Asian organizations.

The Vietnam National Credit Information Center breach stood out as one of Asia's largest-ever data breaches, with over 160 million records stolen – essentially the entire adult population. Major Japanese corporations like Asahi Breweries faced operational disruptions, while South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang dealt with the fallout from a massive customer data breach affecting 33 million users. These incidents occurred against a backdrop of intensifying state-sponsored activities from Chinese and North Korean threat actors.

## Major Regional Incidents

### Vietnam National Credit Database Breach

- **Date:** September 11-12, 2025 (announced)
- **Target:** National Credit Information Center (CIC) - central credit bureau
- **Attack Type:** Data breach
- **Impact:** Over 160 million records stolen (entire adult population)
- **Attribution:** Suspected ShinyHunters group
- **Data Stolen:** Personal and financial data for essentially all Vietnamese borrowers
- **Details:** Hackers (suspected ShinyHunters) infiltrated Vietnam's National Credit Information Center (CIC) – the central credit bureau – and stole over 160 million records on Vietnamese borrowers. This trove likely included personal and financial data for essentially the entire adult population. Vietnam's cybersecurity agency confirmed unauthorized access aimed at data theft and said the extent was still being assessed. The attack did not cripple operations of the credit system but raised fears of fraud and identity theft. It also prompted Vietnam's central bank to warn financial institutions to strengthen cyber defenses. The sheer scale of 160 million records (in a nation of ~98 million people) makes this breach a regional critical incident, with potential ripple effects (e.g., leaked data being used in scams across Asia). Authorities believed the same ShinyHunters group has targeted companies like Google and Microsoft before, showing global threat actor reach.

### Asahi Breweries (Japan)

- **Date:** September 29, 2025
- **Target:** Asahi Group Holdings (Japan's largest brewing company)
- **Attack Type:** Cyber attack
- **Impact:** Forced halt of large portions of business operations
- **Systems Affected:**
  - Beer ordering systems
  - Shipping logistics
  - Call centers
  - Customer service
- **Duration:** Multiple days of complete suspension across Japan
- **Data:** No confirmed personal data leakage reported
- **Attribution:** Not publicly identified immediately (under investigation as of end of September)
- **Details:** Asahi Group Holdings, Japan's largest brewing company, was hit by a cyber attack that forced it to halt large portions of its business. Asahi's domestic operations – including beer ordering systems, shipping logistics, call centers, and customer service – were completely suspended across Japan for multiple days. The company reported no confirmed personal data leakage, and as of the end of September the incident was still under investigation. The threat actor wasn't publicly identified immediately. This attack on a flagship Japanese firm caused concern about supply chain and economic impact; notably, it disrupted distribution of popular beverages nationwide. Japan's government indicated it would treat the Asahi breach as a matter of economic security, given the potential influence on food supply chains. The incident underscored that Japanese industries (even those not traditionally seen as tech targets) are firmly in cyber criminals' sights.

### Coupang (South Korea)

- **Date:** Breach earlier in 2025; disclosure events ongoing in September
- **Target:** Coupang (South Korea's largest e-commerce company)
- **Attack Type:** Customer data breach
- **Impact:** Over 33 million customers affected
- **Legal Actions:** U.S. class-action lawsuit filed in September
- **Data Exposed:** Names, contacts, purchase histories
- **Details:** In September, South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang faced fallout from a massive customer data breach that had occurred sometime prior. By late September, Coupang publicly apologized for the breach of personal information affecting over 33 million customers. Although the hack itself happened earlier, September saw a U.S. class-action lawsuit filed against Coupang for allegedly misleading investors about its security and not disclosing the breach promptly. The exposed data included names, contacts, and purchase histories. South Korean authorities launched investigations and considered penalties under the Personal Information Protection Act. This case highlighted cybersecurity as a corporate governance issue in Korea, and it echoes the need for stronger data protection as mandated by new amendments passed in 2023. While not a September attack per se, the public and legal repercussions peaked this month, making it significant regional news.

### Kolkata Police Cyber Crime Unit (India)

- **Date:** August 2025 (revealed in September)
- **Target:** Kolkata Police Cyber Crime wing database
- **Attack Type:** Data breach due to weak security
- **Cause:** Weak internal passwords and lack of access controls
- **Impact:** Investigative data and citizen complaint records accessed
- **Details:** In India, a notable incident came to light involving a breach of the Kolkata Police's Cyber Crime wing database in August. Due to weak internal passwords and lack of access controls, attackers managed to access investigative data and citizen complaint records. The breach was reported in early September in Indian media and raised alarm about law enforcement IT security. Although not an attack on critical infrastructure, it was embarrassing for a cyber crime unit to be compromised. India did not report any major new cyberattacks in September 2025 affecting critical sectors. However, the government used this quiet period to push cybersecurity initiatives – for example, the Cyber Swaraj campaign continued to promote citizen awareness, and the IT ministry (MeitY) issued fresh cybersecurity audit guidelines in July 2025 (with compliance checks ongoing through September). The absence of a headline-grabbing attack in India in September was seen as a relief, though experts warned that Indian organizations should not become complacent given the surge in attacks in neighboring regions.
