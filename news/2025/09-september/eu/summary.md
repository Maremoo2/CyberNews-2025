# September 2025 - European Union Summary

## Overview

Europe faced several high-profile cyber incidents in September 2025, alongside important regulatory developments. Major data breaches struck organizations in both the private and public sectors, while ransomware and supply-chain attacks disrupted operations at European companies. EU institutions also advanced new cybersecurity legislation, including efforts to streamline incident reporting and bolster critical infrastructure resilience.

The month saw major disruptions including the four-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover factories, the Collins Aerospace attack affecting major European airports, and the shocking breach of Kido International nurseries exposing data on 8,000 children. These incidents occurred against the backdrop of continuing EU regulatory evolution, with new Critical Entity Resilience (CER) Directive guidelines and the launch of the Digital Omnibus simplification initiative.

## Key Trends

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Exposed

The ShinyHunters campaign targeting Salesforce OAuth tokens demonstrated the cascading impact of supply chain compromises:

**European Victims:**
- **Stellantis (Netherlands/Multinational):** Internal emails, documents, and personal information of employees, suppliers, customers, and dealers exposed
- **Zscaler:** Customer contact information and support cases leaked
- **Palo Alto Networks:** Salesforce data compromised
- **Cloudflare:** Support data and APIs exposed

**Attack Vector:**
- Compromised OAuth tokens from Salesloft/Drift Salesforce integrations
- Voice-phishing (vishing) to trick vendor support staff
- Access to CRM systems across multiple organizations
- Attribution to ShinyHunters (UNC6395)

**Implications:**
- Demonstrated risks of trusted third-party relationships
- Highlighted need for OAuth token security
- Prompted calls for stronger vendor security audits
- Raised questions about supply chain oversight requirements

### Critical Infrastructure Attacks

**Jaguar Land Rover (UK/Slovakia):**
- Attack date: September 1, 2025

- Initial assessment: No customer data compromised
- Later findings: Some sensitive data theft confirmed
- Attribution: "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters" threat group
- Government response: UK underwrote $2 billion loan guarantee
- Significance: Multi-week disruption showed vulnerability of automotive supply chains

**Collins Aerospace Airport Attack (Multiple EU Countries):**
- Attack date: September 19-20, 2025
- Target: vMUSE check-in/boarding system
- Affected airports: Heathrow (UK), Brussels (BE), Berlin (DE), Dublin and Cork (IE)
- Impact: 100+ flights delayed or canceled, manual check-ins required
- Ransomware: HardBit ransomware identified
- Law enforcement: At least one arrest made
- Response: EU authorities called for greater aviation security resilience
- Significance: First major attack on European aviation infrastructure

### Targeting of Vulnerable Populations

**Kido International (UK, operations spanning EU):**
- Attack date: September 26, 2025
- Target: 18 children's nurseries in Greater London
- Victims: Over 8,000 children
- Stolen data: Names, photos, home addresses, family contacts, safeguarding notes
- Attackers: Radiant ransomware group (claiming Russia-based)
- Proof of breach: Posted data on 10 children initially
- Threats: Promised to release 30 more children's records and 100 employee records
- Expert reaction: "An absolute new low" - Check Point
- EU implications: GDPR violations, child protection concerns
- Investigation: Europol and national cyber units cooperating
- Status: Attackers remained at large as of end of September

**GDPR and Child Protection:**
- Severe violation of EU data protection laws
- Heightened sensitivity due to victims being minors
- International cooperation due to Kido's operations in US and India
- Prompted review of security requirements for child-care providers

### Regulatory Developments

**Critical Entity Resilience (CER) Directive Guidelines (Sept 11):**
- European Commission published non-binding guidelines
- Purpose: Support Member States in implementing CER Directive
- Focus: Identifying "critical entities" providing essential services
- Key criteria:
  - Organizations where incidents could have significant cross-border impact
  - Physical infrastructure location within Member States
  - Cross-sector and cross-border risk considerations
- Cooperation: Emphasis on coordination with NIS2 authorities
- Goal: Improve uniform resilience planning across EU

**Digital Omnibus Simplification Initiative (Mid-September):**
- European Commission opened call for evidence
- Announced by President von der Leyen in Sept 10 State of the Union speech
- Purpose: Streamline EU digital regulations
- Cybersecurity focus: Harmonize incident reporting requirements
- Problem addressed: Duplicate cyber incident notifications across overlapping EU laws
- Business response: Positive reaction to reduced compliance burdens
- Goal: More unified and business-friendly cyber governance

**EU Data Act Commencement (Sept 12):**
- Core provisions became partially applicable
- Focus: Data access and cloud portability
- Indirect security benefits:
  - Reduces vendor lock-in
  - Improves resilience through provider switching
  - Complements cybersecurity laws (NIS2, Cyber Resilience Act)
- Obligations: Sharing industrial data, customer cloud switching rights

**Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Alignment:**
- Ongoing preparation for CRA enforcement (from 2026)
- Norway (EEA) integrated CRA into legal framework
- Member States mapping CRA product security requirements
- Key deadline: From September 11, 2026, manufacturers must report actively exploited vulnerabilities within 24 hours
- Companies enhancing vulnerability disclosure processes

## Major Incidents Summary

**Harrods (UK):**
- Date: September 30, 2025
- Breach: Third-party vendor breach exposed 430,000 customers
- Data: Names and contact details (no payment info)
- Response: Refused to negotiate with attackers

- Impact: EU-adjacent, affecting European customers

**Other Notable EU Incidents:**
- Hackney Council (UK): Local authority ransomware disrupted services
- German firms: 34% suffered ransomware attacks (Bitkom survey)
- Union County, Ohio (USA): Prompted EU transatlantic info-sharing
