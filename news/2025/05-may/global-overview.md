# Cybersecurity Incidents – May 2025

## Global Overview

### Trends & Analysis

May 2025 saw a surge in high-profile cyber incidents worldwide. Ransomware attacks continued at a rampant pace, disrupting healthcare, education, and critical services across multiple countries. Notably, a system-wide ransomware outage at Kettering Health (Ohio, USA) forced cancellations of medical procedures, while a cyberattack on Covenant Health crippled hospital operations in Maine and New Hampshire. Threat actors also targeted vital infrastructure: hackers breached a Wisconsin city network, exposing 67,000 individuals' data, and a major DDoS attack in Moscow knocked out internet service for tens of thousands.

On the cyber-espionage front, state-backed groups were active – for example, North Korean APT TA406 targeted Ukrainian government agencies, and Russian-aligned hackers launched a spying campaign in Central Asia (Tajikistan). Financially motivated breaches hit global companies: Coca-Cola had internal data leaked after refusing an Everest ransomware ransom, and data broker LexisNexis disclosed a breach affecting 364,000 individuals. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency platforms suffered massive heists, including Cetus Protocol losing $223 million to hackers.

These incidents underscore that healthcare and finance were among the most targeted sectors globally, with ransomware remaining the dominant attack type. Critical vulnerabilities were actively exploited as well – Chinese state hackers, for instance, leveraged a flaw in Ivanti's mobile device management software to breach high-profile organizations worldwide.
