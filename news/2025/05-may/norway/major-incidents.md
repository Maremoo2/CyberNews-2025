# May 2025 - Norway Major Incidents

## National Cyber Incidents

### April 7, 2025 (Disclosed August 2025) – Bremanger Hydropower Dam

- **Date:** April 7, 2025 (attack occurred); disclosed publicly in August 2025; under investigation in May 2025
- **Target:** Bremanger hydropower dam (western Norway)
- **Attack Type:** Critical infrastructure sabotage / cyberattack on control systems
- **Impact:** Hackers opened a floodgate releasing 500 liters of water per second for four hours; no casualties but potential danger to downstream areas
- **Attribution:** Cyber Patriot hacktivist group with ties to Russian interests; Norway's Police Security Service (PST) confirmed Russia's involvement as demonstration of capability
- **Details:** Pro-Russian hackers breached the control systems of a dam in western Norway and opened a floodgate to release 500 liters of water per second for four hours. The unauthorized release did not cause casualties but could have endangered downstream areas. The attack went undetected initially and was stopped manually. While not publicly attributed until August, Norwegian authorities in May were already investigating this and similar incidents. This marked the first known cyberattack on Norway's physical infrastructure with real-world physical manipulation. A video was later posted on Telegram claiming credit. PST's head Beate Gangås described it as part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy aimed at causing harm and showcasing capability.

### May 2025 – Norwegian Government Ministries (Follow-up)

- **Date:** May 2025
- **Target:** Norwegian government offices
- **Attack Type:** Supply-chain attack (2022 incident follow-up)
- **Impact:** No new breaches; security overhaul completed including replacing vulnerable software and enhancing network monitoring
- **Attribution:** Original 2022 incident attributed to likely Chinese state-backed group exploiting IT service provider
- **Details:** Norwegian government offices were still dealing with the aftermath of the 2022 ministry hack where 12 ministries were compromised via a software supply chain breach. In May, the government provided an update that while no new breaches occurred, they had completed a security overhaul of IT systems. This included replacing vulnerable software and significantly enhancing network monitoring capabilities. The status report indicated no successful major intrusions in recent months, despite numerous attempts, demonstrating improved government cyber defenses.

### May 2025 – Private Sector Incidents

#### Maritime Firm Network Outage

- **Date:** Mid-May 2025
- **Target:** Large Norwegian maritime firm
- **Attack Type:** Initially suspected cyberattack; turned out to be technical fault
- **Impact:** Network outage that prompted urgent review of maritime cyber resilience
- **Details:** A large Norwegian maritime firm experienced a network outage mid-May that was initially feared to be a cyberattack. While it turned out to be a technical fault, the incident prompted an urgent review of maritime sector cyber resilience, highlighting the heightened state of alert in Norway.

#### Norsk Hydro Attempted Intrusion

- **Date:** May 2025
- **Target:** Norsk Hydro (which suffered major ransomware attack in 2019)
- **Attack Type:** Attempted intrusion via phishing
- **Impact:** Systems detected and blocked malware; no successful compromise
- **Details:** Norsk Hydro reported fending off an attempted intrusion in May. Their systems successfully detected and blocked malware sent via phishing emails, demonstrating significantly improved cybersecurity readiness compared to their 2019 ransomware incident. This showcased the value of prior investments in security improvements.

### May 2025 – Espionage & Threat Activity

#### Defense Sector Phishing

- **Date:** May 2025
- **Target:** Individuals in Norway's defense sector
- **Attack Type:** Phishing campaign
- **Attribution:** Suspected Russian phishing campaign masquerading as Ukrainian officials
- **Details:** PST revealed in its May threat update that Norwegian entities faced heightened espionage attempts, especially from Russia. Individuals in Norway's defense sector received phishing emails masquerading as Ukrainian officials, likely part of Russian intelligence-gathering campaigns.

#### Academic Institution Breach

- **Date:** May 2025
- **Target:** Norwegian academic institution
- **Attack Type:** Research data breach
- **Attribution:** Suspected Chinese espionage targeting oceanographic research
- **Details:** At least one academic institution in Norway reported a breach of research data in May, suspected to be Chinese espionage aiming at oceanographic research (where Norway leads in maritime technology). The incident was handled quietly and did not result in publicly known damage, but underscored constant low-level cyber espionage activity targeting Norwegian research and technology sectors.

## Government Response & Investigation

### PST and NSM Activities

In May 2025, Norwegian authorities were actively investigating the Bremanger dam attack (though not publicly disclosed until August):

- PST (Police Security Service) and NSM (Norwegian National Security Authority) escalated their public warnings
- PST's annual threat assessment (released February 2025) was actively referenced, warning that pro-Russian cyber groups pose the biggest digital threat to Norway's security
- **May 5**: Justice Minister held press conference urging all operators of critical infrastructure (power, water, transport) to be on high alert and report anomalies to NSM
- Increased monitoring of key facilities' networks through the Veileder program (collaboration between intelligence services and industry)

### NATO and International Cooperation

- **May 2025**: Norwegian cyber experts participated in NATO cyber defense exercise (Locked Shields 2025) to test joint responses to attacks on power grids and telecoms
- **Mid-May**: Norway signed a cybersecurity information-sharing agreement with Sweden and Denmark, focusing on protecting the energy sector in Scandinavia
- **May 18**: Government launched initiative to improve cyber incident drills, funding a new Cyber Range at a Norwegian university to simulate attacks and train responders

## Impact Assessment

- **First known cyberattack** on Norway's physical infrastructure with operational impact
- **Four-hour unauthorized release** of water from critical hydropower infrastructure
- **No casualties** but demonstrated potential for physical harm
- **Heightened national security concern** about Russia's capabilities and intentions
- **Successful defense** of multiple attempted intrusions due to improved readiness
- **Constant low-level espionage** activity targeting defense and research sectors
