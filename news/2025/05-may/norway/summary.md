# May 2025 - Norway Summary

## Overview

Norway's cybersecurity environment in May 2025 can be characterized as heightened alert with a sharp focus on critical infrastructure protection. Though not publicly disclosed until August, the Bremanger dam sabotage in April was under investigation in May and fundamentally shifted perceptions of cyber threats in Norway. The month demonstrated that Norway, despite strong cyber defenses, faces sophisticated threats capable of creating physical damage or disruption.

## Key Trends

### Critical Infrastructure Protection

The revelation of the dam sabotage (even though publicly confirmed later, officials were aware by May) was a watershed moment for Norwegian cybersecurity:

- **Shift in Perception**: Cyber transformed from primarily an information security issue to a clear national security and public safety issue
- **Physical Impact Demonstrated**: The attack showed that cyber operations can directly manipulate physical infrastructure with potential for casualties
- **Accelerated Security Projects**: Utility companies began accelerating projects to separate and better secure operational technology (OT) networks
- **PST Validation**: The incident validated warnings that Russia might target Norway's energy infrastructure as part of hybrid warfare tactics

### Russia-Ukraine War Cyber Fallout

As a close NATO ally and Europe's largest gas supplier, Norway remained a high-value target for Russian cyber operations:

- **Continuous Low-Level Activity**: Throughout spring 2025, Norway faced a barrage of activities from pro-Russian actors
- **DDoS Campaigns**: Mainly targeting government websites causing minor outages
- **Oil & Gas Targeting**: Attempts to breach Norwegian energy companies' networks (likely for espionage or sabotage preparation)
- **Hacktivist Groups**: Killnet and similar groups targeting Norwegian entities due to Norway's support for Ukraine
- **Successful Defense**: Most attempts in May were successfully defended, though they kept threat levels high

### Improved Cyber Readiness and Coordination

On a positive note, Norway demonstrated significant improvements in cybersecurity capabilities:

- **Agency Coordination**: Seamless interplay between PST, NSM, and sectoral CERTs
- **Quick Investigation**: Rapid attribution of the dam incident by summer demonstrated investigative capabilities
- **Proactive Defense**: NSM detected and quietly mitigated an attempted intrusion targeting a defense contractor's email server in May (using recently disclosed Exchange server flaw)
- **Intelligence-Led Defense**: Leveraging threat intelligence to harden potential targets ahead of attacks
- **Prior Investments Paying Off**: The National Cyber Security Centre (established 2019) enabled early detection of some intrusions

### Cybercrime Landscape

Norway's cybercrime remained at lower levels compared to larger countries, but showed growth:

- **Phishing and BEC Scams**: Norwegian businesses (especially finance and shipping) reported increased activity
- **Ransomware**: No major public incidents in May, but many SMEs likely dealt with smaller infections quietly
- **Extortion Without Encryption**: Trend observed by NorCERT of criminals threatening to leak stolen data from Norwegian firms, made easier when companies have good backups but still fear data exposure
- **Manufacturing Sector**: A few mid-sized manufacturing firms reportedly affected in early 2025 (known anecdotally in security community)

### Political and Public Awareness

Cyber threats gained significant visibility in Norwegian politics and public discourse:

- **Arendalsuka Planning**: Cyber was a topic for the annual political forum in August, indicating leadership priority
- **Budget Implications**: The dam event likely influenced Norway's 2026 budget planning to allocate more funds to cyber defense
- **Emergency Funding**: In May, relevant committees hinted at emergency funding for critical infrastructure cybersecurity upgrades
- **Media Coverage**: Increased public interest in cybersecurity following various incidents

### PST Security Warnings

Following the dam attack discovery, intensified public warnings:

- **May 5**: Justice Minister press conference urging critical infrastructure operators to be on high alert
- **Threat Assessment**: PST's annual assessment (February 2025) actively referenced, identifying pro-Russian cyber groups as biggest digital threat
- **Monitoring Program**: Increased surveillance of key facilities' networks through Veileder program
- **Reporting**: Urged all anomaly reporting to NSM

### Cyber Collaboration Initiatives

- **NATO Exercise**: Participation in Locked Shields 2025 to test joint responses to power grid and telecom attacks
- **Scandinavian Agreement**: Mid-May cybersecurity information-sharing agreement with Sweden and Denmark for energy sector protection
- **Cyber Range**: May 18 announcement of funding for new Cyber Range at Norwegian university to simulate attacks and train responders

### Public Awareness Campaign

- **Launch**: May 2025
- **Name**: "Sikkert Samfunn 2025" (Secure Society 2025)
- **Channels**: Social media and TV spots
- **Content**: Advice on two-factor authentication, identifying scam messages, updating software
- **Rationale**: May survey showed over 60% of Norwegians worried about identity theft
- **Goal**: Reduce human-factor risks through preventative education

## Looking Ahead

Norway's statistics depict a nation that, while small in population, is a strategic cyber target facing sophisticated threats. The low number of successful breaches is encouraging but tempered by the high stakes of attacks like the dam incident. 

Quantitatively, Norway's share of global cyberattacks is small, but qualitatively, the attacks it faces are often high-impact or state-linked. The country's proactive measures seem to be containing the volume of successful attacks, but the events of April/May 2025 underscored that absolute security is elusive and constant vigilance is warranted.

Key priorities moving forward include:
- Implementing the Digital Security Act (October 2025)
- Hardening operational technology (OT) networks in critical infrastructure
- Maintaining heightened alert posture given Russia-Ukraine conflict spillover
- Continuing international cooperation through NATO and Scandinavian partnerships
- Improving public cyber hygiene through awareness campaigns
- Ensuring adequate funding for critical infrastructure cybersecurity upgrades

The combination of strong legislative frameworks (DSA, DORA transposition), improved coordination (PST, NSM, sectoral CERTs), and high public awareness positions Norway well to address future cyber threats, though the persistent nature of state-sponsored threats requires ongoing vigilance and investment.
