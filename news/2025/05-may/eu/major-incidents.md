## State-Sponsored Espionage Targeting EU and Allies

### May 2025 (ongoing) – European Government & Agencies

- **Date:** May 2025 (ongoing)
- **Target:** EU institutions, government agencies, and research entities
- **Attack Type:** State-sponsored espionage
- **Impact:** Continued cyber espionage attempts; potential intelligence gathering
- **Attribution:** Russian-affiliated hackers (Central Asia campaign) and Chinese APTs (Ivanti exploits)
