# May 2025 - European Union Summary

## Overview

European cybersecurity in May 2025 was marked by a barrage of attacks on the retail and finance sectors, coupled with heightened state-sponsored threat activity. The month saw significant developments in EU cyber policy alongside a wave of sophisticated attacks targeting major corporations and critical infrastructure.

## Key Trends

### Coordinated Attacks on UK Retail Sector

The UK retail sector was under siege, with companies like Marks & Spencer, Harrods, and the Co-op facing intrusions that were often claimed by the Southeast Asian hacktivist group DragonForce. This trend suggested a politically motivated campaign blending with cybercrime, as DragonForce publicized the attacks as part of an anti-Western agenda. The coordinated nature of these attacks demonstrated a shift from opportunistic targeting to strategic campaigns against specific sectors.

### Manufacturing and Supply Chain Disruption

In the EU proper, large enterprises in Germany, France, and the Nordics experienced significant disruption. Manufacturing operations like Arla Foods were hit, reflecting a shift of ransomware crews toward critical supply chains. This trend raised serious concerns about food security and the vulnerability of essential production infrastructure to cyber attacks.

### Evolution of Ransomware Tactics

Security analysts noted that ransomware remained the top threat in Europe, but data extortion without encryption also rose – exemplified by the Coca-Cola and Pearson breaches where data theft occurred without major IT downtime. This evolution demonstrates that threat actors are adapting their tactics to maximize pressure on victims while potentially avoiding some defensive measures focused on detecting encryption activities.

### Persistent Breach Aftershocks

European organizations continued to deal with aftershocks of breaches from previous months. For instance, in May there were new developments in the Star Health Insurance case (an Indian insurer with EU customers) where the hacker "Xenzen" who leaked 31 million records in 2024 was found sending physical threat messages to executives. Such cases highlighted the persistent risks from data leaked months prior and the long-term impacts of breaches.

### Insider Threats and Human Error

Insider threats and human error also emerged prominently in Europe's threat landscape. An incident at a UK children's hospital involved an employee illicitly accessing 314 patient records. Additionally, a major IT outage at 45 hospitals (linked to Oracle Health software) was traced to accidental data deletion by IT staff. These non-malicious causes emphasize that cybersecurity in Europe must encompass internal safeguards and resilience, not just external threat prevention.

### State-Sponsored Threat Activity

Geopolitically, EU officials in May warned of elevated state-sponsored cyber aggression. Russia's cyber operations remained a foremost concern for EU and NATO members, given incidents like a pro-Ukraine hacker group retaliating against a Russian clinic and revelations of Russian cyber-espionage campaigns in allied regions. Chinese cyber espionage was also on the radar, as EU agencies tracked Chinese APT groups exploiting software supply chains used in Europe, particularly the Ivanti EPMM vulnerability.

### Most Targeted Sectors and Attack Vectors

The most targeted sectors in Europe during May were:
1. **Retail** - unusual spike due to concentrated targeting of major retailers
2. **Finance** - traditionally high-target sector remained heavily attacked
3. **Healthcare** - continued to face significant threats

Common attack types included:
- Ransomware and data extortion
- Supply-chain compromises
- Phishing-driven breaches leveraging stolen credentials

European organizations increasingly reported attacks leveraging known software vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of patch management under EU guidelines.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### EU Cybersecurity Act Revision

The European Commission launched a public consultation to review the 2019 Cybersecurity Act, aiming to streamline incident reporting and strengthen supply chain security. Proposed changes include:
- Expanding ENISA's mandate (the EU cyber agency)
- Improving the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework

Stakeholders were invited to submit feedback by June 20, 2025, signaling upcoming enhancements to EU-wide security standards and certification of IT products.

### Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

The EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act became fully applicable in January 2025, and by May, implementation was in full swing. Key developments:

- In Q1 2025, the European Commission adopted technical standards under DORA, including rules for incident reporting timelines and threat-led penetration testing requirements
- EU financial entities (banks, insurers, etc.) are now complying with these standards
- Supervisory authorities have started identifying "critical ICT third-party providers" for oversight

This is particularly relevant as ransomware and IT outages can have systemic impacts across the financial sector.

### Data Act & AI Act Developments

While not strictly cybersecurity laws, the EU's broader digital regulation efforts progressed significantly:

- **Data Act:** In May, the final expert report on the Data Act was published, providing model contract terms for B2B data sharing to bolster data security and privacy
- **AI Act:** Discussions continued with new guidelines on General-Purpose AI (GPAI) released on April 22, 2025, and feedback due by May 22. These include provisions on AI system security and risk management, ensuring AI-driven services are not vulnerable to tampering

### EU–Korea Cyber Dialogue

On May 20, 2025, the EU held its seventh Cyber Dialogue with the Republic of Korea in Seoul, exchanging views on cyber policy developments and cooperation. This reflects the EU's international engagement on cybersecurity, aligning strategies with like-minded countries in Asia and sharing best practices on critical infrastructure protection and incident response.

### NIS2 Directive Transposition

EU member states continued to transpose NIS2 Directive requirements into national law (the new Network and Information Security directive which took effect in late 2024). By May:

- Many countries had draft legislation in progress to enforce stricter breach notification rules and security requirements for essential services and digital providers
- Germany and France advanced bills to increase fines for non-compliance with cyber hygiene standards
- Smaller states sought regional cooperation via the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA)

## Statistics

### Ransomware Toll

- **~40% of reported cybersecurity incidents** in the first half of 2025 were ransomware-related
- **Dozens of ransomware attacks** in EU/UK during May alone
- **UK saw spike** in extortion attempts targeting retail and education sectors

## International Cooperation

The EU in May 2025 balanced reactive measures (responding to the rash of cyber attacks with alerts and incident response) and proactive policy efforts (updating laws like the Cybersecurity Act and enforcing new ones like DORA and NIS2). The European Commission's agenda for a "Cyber Resilient Europe" was clearly visible, aiming to harden defenses in both the public and private sectors through regulation and international collaboration.

## Impact Assessment

- **20+ million individuals** potentially affected by data breaches (Co-op alone claimed 20M)
- **Coordinated hacktivist campaigns** targeting UK retail sector by DragonForce
- **Critical food supply chain** disrupted (Arla Foods production halt)
- **Multiple supply chain vulnerabilities** exploited (Adidas, ConnectWise, third-party providers)
- **Dual state-sponsored threats** from Russian and Chinese actors
- **Insider threats** highlighted need for internal security controls
- **Cross-border implications** from multinational corporate breaches

## Looking Ahead

The May 2025 landscape demonstrates that European organizations face a multi-faceted threat environment requiring comprehensive defense strategies. The combination of regulatory modernization (through DORA, NIS2, and Cybersecurity Act revisions) and the persistent evolution of threat actor tactics means that organizations must maintain vigilance across technical defenses, supply chain security, insider threat programs, and rapid incident response capabilities.

The EU's continued emphasis on international cooperation, as evidenced by the Korea Cyber Dialogue and participation in Operation Sentinel, shows recognition that cyber threats transcend borders and require coordinated responses.
