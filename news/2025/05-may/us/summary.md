# May 2025 - United States Summary

## Overview

The United States in May 2025 experienced a high volume of ransomware and extortion attacks, reinforcing trends observed earlier in the year. The month was characterized by significant disruptions to healthcare systems, critical manufacturing, and government services, alongside major data breaches affecting hundreds of thousands of individuals across multiple sectors.

## Key Trends

### Widespread Ransomware Targeting

Ransomware groups targeted a broad array of sectors in May – from healthcare (hospitals, health insurers) to critical manufacturing (steel, food distribution) to municipal governments. A notable pattern was the targeting of mid-sized city and county governments (e.g., Sheboygan, WI), resulting in large numbers of individuals' data being compromised. This suggests ransomware operators were not only pursuing big corporations but also exploiting softer targets with valuable data but potentially weaker defenses.

### Increased Attack Impact and Downtime

The average downtime from ransomware attacks in May increased significantly. Notable examples include:
- Cellcom's week-long telecom outage affecting communications across Wisconsin and Upper Michigan
- Kettering Health's system-wide hospital disruption forcing cancellation of medical procedures
- Covenant Health's multi-day IT systems shutdown forcing reversion to paper records

These incidents indicate that even with improved incident response capabilities, the operational impact of successful attacks remains severe.

### Insider Threats and Social Engineering

The Coinbase incident highlighted a disturbing evolution: attackers are actively recruiting or bribing insiders to bypass technical security controls. Hackers recruited support agents abroad and obtained customer data through this insider scheme, then attempted a $20 million extortion. This tactic complicates purely technical defenses and emphasizes the critical need for robust insider risk programs.

Similarly, the PowerSchool situation demonstrated creative, persistent strategies where hackers steal data from a vendor, then pivot to extort individual school districts. These developments stress the importance of third-party risk management among U.S. organizations.

### Critical Infrastructure Under Attack

Critical infrastructure attacks were particularly alarming in May:
- **Food Supply Chain**: UNFI (United Natural Foods Inc.), a major grocery distributor, was restoring systems after a late April ransomware attack confirmed in early May
- **Steel Manufacturing**: Nucor Corporation, the largest U.S. steelmaker, experienced production outages
- **Telecommunications**: Cellcom's extended outage demonstrated vulnerability of regional carriers
- **Healthcare**: Multiple hospital systems (Kettering, Covenant, Ascension) faced disruptions

These incidents demonstrate ransomware's reach into sectors that directly affect daily life and highlight vulnerabilities similar to the Colonial Pipeline attack of 2021.

### State-Sponsored Activity

While less visibly reported than ransomware, state-sponsored activity remained a significant concern:
- The ConnectWise breach was suspected to be nation-state espionage aimed at IT supply chains
- Chinese hackers exploiting enterprise software vulnerabilities (Ivanti mobile management flaw) affecting U.S. companies
- Russian hackers' campaigns in Eastern Europe with potential indirect spillover effects

Though there were no publicly disclosed major federal government breaches in May, the espionage threat level remained high, reflected in CISA and NSA alerts about advanced persistent threats and zero-day vulnerabilities.

### Defensive Improvements

On the positive side, U.S. businesses and government agencies continued improving their cyber posture:
- Many organizations rolled out mandated multi-factor authentication (MFA) following White House Executive Order requirements
- Growing adoption of "zero trust" architecture in federal IT systems
- Federal agencies meeting cybersecurity milestones discussed at mid-May Federal CIO Council meeting
- Private companies showing increased interest in cyber insurance and FIDO2 security keys for phishing-resistant MFA

### Attack Techniques and Tactics

In terms of attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs):
- **Phishing and credential theft** remained the top initial access methods for most U.S. incidents
- **Zero-day exploits** were actively used, including an Apache Parquet library vulnerability
- **Emerging threats** included the MOVEit Transfer file transfer zero-day (discovered in late May, exploited publicly in June)
- The pattern of Clop attacks foreshadowed upcoming major exploitation campaigns

## Government & Policy Initiatives

### CISA AI Security Guidance

On May 22, 2025, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with the NSA, FBI, and partners in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, released new guidance titled "Managing AI Data Security Risk." The guidance provides best practices for:
- Protecting data used in AI/ML models
- Mitigating risks like data poisoning
- Securing the AI supply chain
- Preventing unauthorized model tampering

This initiative reflects U.S. government focus on emerging technology security as AI adoption grows across defense contractors, critical infrastructure operators, and federal agencies.

### NIST IoT Cybersecurity Update

On May 13, 2025, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced a draft revision to its key IoT cybersecurity guidance (NIST IR 8259), the first major update since the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020. Key changes include:

- Expanding scope from "IoT devices" to entire "IoT products and ecosystems"
- Adding guidelines for manufacturers to plan secure IoT device lifecycles
- Addressing firmware updates, secure onboarding, and end-of-life device data protection
- Including post-deployment support and data management guidance

NIST held public workshops and a forum (June 18) to gather feedback. Once finalized, these guidelines will inform procurement standards for IoT in government and influence industry best practices.

### Federal Cybersecurity Strategy

The administration continued implementing its cyber agenda throughout May:

**Cyber Trust Mark Program**: The FCC prepared the rollout of the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark labeling for IoT products (announced July 2024) to go live in 2025. Manufacturers were aligning with NIST criteria to qualify their smart devices for this security label.

**State and Local Cyber Grants**: DHS announced allocation of $91.7 million in funding for the FY2025 State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP) to help states fortify their cyber defenses, with many states submitting proposals in May for election system security and network modernization.

**Critical Infrastructure Focus**: Following high-profile breaches, CISA held workshops with energy and healthcare sectors in May to share threat intelligence. Sector-specific cybersecurity performance goals (CPGs) were being updated, with new guidelines for water systems and hospitals expected by summer.

### Legislative Developments

Congress saw relatively quiet activity on new cybersecurity bills in May (likely overshadowed by budget debates), but two bipartisan bills gained traction:
1. A bill focusing on ransomware payments reporting (requiring organizations to report ransom payments to DHS/CISA)
2. A bill to establish Cloud Security Certification for federal vendors

Hearings in late May discussed recent breaches (LexisNexis, Coinbase) to advocate for stronger data protection laws. The FTC signaled it would use its authority to penalize companies for inadequate cybersecurity.

### DOJ Enforcement

The Department of Justice ramped up use of the False Claims Act on cybersecurity cases. In May, DOJ announced intervention in a whistleblower lawsuit against a government contractor accused of misrepresenting its cybersecurity controls on federal projects. This is part of the "Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative," aimed at holding contractors accountable for failing to meet cyber standards.

- **Average ransom demand: ~$5 million** (though most victims did not pay)
- **One publicly known demand: $10 million** (UNFI food distributor case)
- **Interlock ransomware** emerged as a new threat (Kettering Health attack)
- Established gangs like **LockBit and ALPHV/BlackCat** remained active

### Data Breach Numbers

- **600,000+ individuals** in the U.S. had personal data impacted by breaches disclosed in May:
  - 364,000 from LexisNexis
  - 430,000 patients in Ascension's case
  - ~67,000 residents in Sheboygan county
  - Thousands more across smaller breaches (Insight Partners, school districts, etc.)
- **15% increase** in reported data breach victims year-to-date compared to 2024 (per Identity Theft Resource Center)

### Most Targeted Sectors

1. **Healthcare** - led in number of incidents (numerous hospital and clinic cases)
2. **Education** - many K-12 and higher education breaches
3. **Government** - state and local government attacks
4. **Finance** - fewer incidents by number, but large-scale impacts (LexisNexis, Coinbase)
5. **Manufacturing and Telecom** - high-profile outages (Nucor, Cellcom)

This diversification indicates threat actors are moving beyond just Fortune 500 companies.

## Impact Assessment

- **Critical healthcare services** disrupted across multiple states
- **Manufacturing supply chains** affected (steel production, food distribution)
- **Communications infrastructure** compromised (week-long telecom outage)
- **Government services** interrupted (state and county systems)
- **Financial sector** targeted through insider schemes and vendor vulnerabilities
- **Education sector** facing ongoing extortion from prior vendor breaches
- **600,000+ individuals** directly impacted by data breaches

## Looking Ahead

The U.S. trend in May 2025 can be summarized as "more of everything": more attacks, more data at risk, more sectors hit, but also more investment in defense and more government action. The month's events underscored that cyber threats are as much a national security issue as an IT issue, given the impacts on healthcare, finance, and critical services.

The combination of improved reporting (through CISA requirements), enhanced government guidance (AI security, IoT security), and increased enforcement activity (DOJ False Claims Act cases) demonstrates a maturing approach to cybersecurity at the federal level. However, the persistent success of ransomware attacks and the evolution of insider threat tactics indicate that defenders must continue adapting to stay ahead of sophisticated adversaries.
