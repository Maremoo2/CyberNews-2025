### May 8, 2025 – Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA)

- **Date:** May 8, 2025 (reporting on April activity)

On May 27, Chinese authorities in Guangdong accused a Taiwan government-backed hacker group of attacking a mainland Chinese technology company's network. In response, Taiwan's National Security Bureau refuted the claim and accused the Chinese Communist Party of spreading disinformation and conducting long-running cyber intrusions against Taiwan. This exchange highlighted the persistent, politically charged cyber skirmishes in East Asia and the public nature of cyber warfare rhetoric between the two entities.

### May 2025 – India Cyber Incidents

#### Star Health Insurance Breach Aftermath

- **Date:** May 2025 (development from 2024 breach)
- **Target:** Star Health Insurance executives

This came to light in May, illustrating how cybercriminals in India can cross into physical intimidation. The case kept the incident in the news and increased pressure on authorities to apprehend the perpetrators.

- **Details:** India's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) noted that in the first quarter of 2025, India faced approximately 18 million cyberattacks. May continued this trend with a notable phishing campaign targeting Indian taxpayers with fake refund emails, prompting CERT-In to issue public alerts.

### May 2025 – South Korea: Coupang Data Breach Developments

- **Date:** May 2025 (breach occurred later in 2025, but legal activity in May)
- **Target:** Coupang (South Korean e-commerce giant)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach affecting 33.7 million users
- **Impact:** Cross-border data protection issues; U.S. class-action lawsuit filed
- **Attribution:** Former Coupang employee identified as prime suspect
- **Details:** In late May, Coupang faced legal scrutiny after a massive breach (33.7 million users, discovered in November 2025) led to a U.S. class-action lawsuit being filed. While the breach itself occurred later, May saw the beginning of legal proceedings. A former Coupang employee with retained access keys was identified as a prime suspect. Meanwhile, South Korea's regulators were investigating a separate early-2025 incident involving SK Telecom's customer data. These incidents highlighted mounting pressure on large Asian tech firms to improve cybersecurity and demonstrated the cross-border ripple effects of breaches.

### May 10, 2025 – India-Pakistan Cyber Conflict

- **Date:** May 10, 2025
- **Target:** Government websites and critical systems (both countries)
- **Attack Type:** Hacktivist attacks, website defacements, data leaks

Pro-Pakistani hacktivists attempted defacements of Indian state government websites, while Indian hacktivist groups leaked data allegedly from Pakistani critical systems. While largely symbolic, these attacks caused temporary disruptions on some government sites and added a cyber dimension to the regional conflict.

## Emerging Trends & Analysis

### Geopolitical Cyber Warfare

Cybersecurity trends in Asia during May 2025 were heavily influenced by geopolitical tensions and rapid digitization. A major theme was the interplay of state-sponsored attacks and regional conflicts:

- **China-Taiwan Cyber Accusations**: Both sides publicly accused each other of hacking critical systems in May, suggesting a shadow war aiming to undermine government or military capabilities without open conflict
- **India-Pakistan Cyber Skirmishes**: Mirrored cyber offensives by patriotic hacker groups during brief military tensions
- **Regional Power Projection**: Asian nation-states and their proxies are very active in cyberspace, targeting political, military, and economic assets of rivals

### Financial Systems and Cryptocurrency Targeting

Asia's advanced financial markets proved attractive targets:

- **Japan's $2B Unauthorized Trades**: Unique form of cyber fraud exploiting trading accounts to manipulate stocks with potential wider economic implications
- **Cryptocurrency Vulnerabilities**: Asian exchanges and DeFi platforms remained at high risk (Bybit's $1.5B hack earlier in 2025)
- **Insider Threats**: The Coupang breach demonstrated internal security challenges within Asia's tech giants

### Ransomware Growth in Asia

While May's global ransomware wave hit Western targets primarily, Asian organizations faced increasing threats:

- Reports of ransomware attacks on Indian media conglomerate and Japanese steel manufacturer in Q2 2025
- Southeast Asian countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam) saw increased activity from groups like ALPHV
- Many Asian companies likely underreported attacks compared to Western counterparts
- Law enforcement cooperation improving through Interpol operations

### Government Defense Initiatives

Asian governments strengthened cyber defenses in response to threats:

- **Japan**: Accelerated plans for new government cybersecurity incident response center ahead of 2025 Osaka World Expo
- **South Korea**: Implemented amendments to Personal Information Protection Act with increased breach penalties
- **India**: Operationalized National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) guidelines
- **Military Cyber Commands**: Many Asian countries quietly forming cyber commands within their militaries

### Securing Rapid Digital Growth

The pandemic-era digital boom created new vulnerabilities:

- Southeast Asia experienced wave of mobile banking trojans and super-app phishing scams in May
- Thailand and Philippines identified as hotspots for malware distribution (per Trend Micro)
- Need for better cybersecurity awareness among general population
- Singapore's Cyber Security Agency ran public advisories on phishing in May
