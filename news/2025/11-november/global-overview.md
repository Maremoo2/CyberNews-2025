# Cybersecurity Incidents – November 2025

## Global Overview

### Trends & Analysis

November 2025 continued the trend of rising ransomware and supply-chain attacks. Cyble recorded 640 ransomware incidents worldwide (the 2nd-highest monthly total on record), with threat groups increasingly exploiting third-party software. Many breaches involved "silent" data theft (exfiltration without immediate encryption) and heavy impact from social-engineering.

The month demonstrated several concerning patterns:

**Supply-Chain Exploitation:** 58% of ransomware campaigns involved third-party software compromise. Attackers exploited vulnerabilities in widely-used platforms like Oracle E-Business Suite, Salesforce's Gainsight, and legacy alert systems.

**Silent Data Extortion:** A global shift toward "stealth" extortion continued. Many attackers exfiltrated data without immediate encryption, then threatened victims with leaks. This was seen from Cl0p's Oracle EBS hacks to ByteToBreach's disclosure of European company data.

**Critical Infrastructure Targeting:** Attacks increasingly focused on emergency services, utilities, and transportation systems. The CodeRED emergency alert system breach affected dozens of US states, while European rail and water infrastructure faced coordinated intrusions.

**State-Sponsored Activity:** Nation-state actors remained highly active. North Korea's Lazarus Group stole ~$30.6M from Korea's Upbit exchange, while China-linked groups deployed AI-enabled tools for automated cyber-attacks on financial and government targets.

## Major Global Incidents

### November 4 – Balancer (Ethereum DeFi Protocol)

- **Date:** November 4, 2025
- **Target:** Balancer (Ethereum DeFi protocol)
- **Attack Type:** Smart-contract exploit
- **Impact:** ≈$120 million drained from liquidity pools
- **Attribution:** Unknown
- **Details:** Attackers exploited smart contract vulnerabilities in Balancer's protocol to drain approximately $120 million from liquidity pools across multiple blockchain networks. The exploit leveraged the interconnectedness of Balancer v2 pools to maximize the theft.

### November 21 – Gainsight (Salesforce Platform)

- **Date:** November 21, 2025
- **Target:** Gainsight (Salesforce customer-management platform)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach via compromised tokens
- **Impact:** Hundreds of companies' data exposed
- **Attribution:** ShinyHunters ransomware group
- **Details:** The ShinyHunters threat actor group claimed to have used compromised Gainsight tokens to access data of hundreds of organizations.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### EU "Digital Omnibus" (November 19, 2025)

The European Commission proposed a single package to simplify rules on digital services. It includes streamlined incident reporting requirements and revised cybersecurity provisions under EU law, along with new provisions for AI regulation and data sharing across the EU.

### India DPDP Rules (November 13, 2025)

India formally enacted its Digital Personal Data Protection rules. Companies must now collect only necessary data and notify individuals/regulators of breaches. This brings India's privacy law into full force, requiring companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI to limit data collection to specific purposes.

### US/UK/Australia Sanctions (November 19, 2025)

The US Treasury (OFAC) and counterparts in the UK and Australia imposed sanctions on Media Land LLC (a Russian bulletproof hosting provider) and affiliates. Media Land was identified as a key enabler of ransomware groups like LockBit. This trilateral action targets the infrastructure behind global cybercrime.

### US Cybersecurity Funding (November 2025)

The U.S. Congress extended two lapsed cyber laws: the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Act (CISA) and the State/Local Cybersecurity Grant Program. This ensures continued legal safe-harbor for threat-sharing and billions in federal cyber grant funding for state/local government resilience. The Business Software Alliance praised the extensions, warning that continued delays risk deepening information-sharing gaps between public and private sectors.

## Overlapping Trends Across Regions

### Ransomware & Supply Chains
All regions saw ransomware surging alongside supply-chain attacks. Europe had supply-chain breaches at companies like Almaviva and Miljödata, while US victims included Salesforce's Gainsight and Oracle customers (Harvard, Cox, Dartmouth).

### Silent Data Extortion
A global shift toward "stealth" extortion continued. Many attackers exfiltrated data without immediate encryption, then threatened victims with leaks. This was seen from Cl0p's Oracle EBS hacks to ByteToBreach's disclosure of European company data.

### Cross-border APT Activity
State-backed APT threats overlapped Asia and beyond. North Korean groups struck both Asia (Upbit) and used internationally routed malware, while Chinese-linked hackers targeted multinationals via AI tools. Meanwhile, EU firms and agencies faced espionage-style intrusions, underscoring the global nature of nation-state campaigns.

### Government Coordination
Policymakers responded in kind across regions. The US, UK, EU and Australia coordinated sanctions and information-sharing, while regulations (data privacy laws in India/EU, and extended CISA in the US) reflect a worldwide push to strengthen cyber defenses and incident transparency.
