### November 26 – London Councils (UK)

- **Date:** November 26, 2025
- **Target:** London Councils (UK – Kensington & Chelsea; Westminster; Hammersmith & Fulham)
- **Attack Type:** Cyber-attack (unknown type)
- **Impact:** Services for over half a million residents disrupted; phone and computer systems shut down
- **Attribution:** Unknown (investigation ongoing by UK's NCSC/NCA)
- **Details:** Three local councils sharing IT infrastructure reported coordinated intrusions on November 26. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), Westminster City Council, and Hammersmith & Fulham Council all experienced cyber incidents that forced them to shut down phone and computer systems as a precaution.

  Emergency plans were activated across all three councils. Services for over half a million residents were disrupted, including tax and parking services, social care, and other essential local government functions. Though no theft of records has been confirmed at the time of disclosure, the councils took immediate action to prevent further unauthorized access.

  RBKC established the cause of the cyber incident on Wednesday but declined to give further details, citing the involvement of the National Crime Agency (NCA) and National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of GCHQ. The investigation is ongoing, with no identified attacker yet.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### EU "Digital Omnibus" Regulation (November 19, 2025)

On November 19, the European Commission proposed the "Digital Omnibus" Regulation, a comprehensive package designed to streamline cybersecurity incident-reporting, data sharing, and AI rules across the EU. This initiative is part of the Commission's broader strategy to simplify EU digital rules and boost innovation.

**Key Components:**
- **Streamlined Incident Reporting:** Consolidates reporting requirements across multiple EU cybersecurity directives
- **Data Sharing:** New provisions to unlock high-quality data for AI development
- **AI Regulation:** Complementary rules that work alongside the EU AI Act
- **Business Wallets:** Digital identity solutions to simplify cross-border business operations

The Digital Omnibus aims to save billions for businesses by reducing regulatory complexity while maintaining high cybersecurity and privacy standards. It represents a significant evolution in EU digital policy, recognizing the need to balance security requirements with business efficiency.

### NIS2 Implementation Progress

EU Member States continued implementing the NIS2 directive throughout November. The directive expands cybersecurity requirements to more sectors and imposes stricter incident reporting timelines (24-hour initial notification, 72-hour full report). November's incidents, particularly the coordinated London councils attack, underscore the importance of these requirements for essential services.

### Regional Coordination

The EU continued strengthening its Cyber Solidarity Act framework, which entered force earlier in 2025. November's incidents demonstrated the need for cross-border incident response, as attacks on shared IT infrastructure (like the London councils) and supply-chain compromises (like Almaviva) can cascade across member states.

## Statistics

### Incident Volume

European countries experienced significant ransomware and cyber-attack activity in November:

- **UK:** ~35-40 ransomware incidents (second only to the US globally)
- **Germany:** Similar levels of activity (~35-40 incidents)
- **Italy:** Among top-targeted countries
- **France:** Multiple significant incidents including Eurofiber

### Personal Data Breaches

- **Miljödata (Sweden):** ~1.5 million individuals affected
- **Eurofiber (France):** ~10,000 business customers' data compromised
- **Almaviva (Italy):** ~2.3 TB of sensitive rail infrastructure data stolen
- **London Councils (UK):** Potentially affecting 500,000+ residents

### Sector Impact

November saw attacks across critical sectors:
- **Municipal Services:** Swedish municipalities via Miljödata
- **Transportation Infrastructure:** Italian rail via Almaviva
- **Telecommunications:** French fiber operator Eurofiber
- **Local Government:** London councils

### Supply-Chain Attacks

Multiple November incidents in Europe involved supply-chain compromises:
- Miljödata serving 200 Swedish municipalities
- Almaviva providing IT services to Italy's rail system
- Shared IT infrastructure serving three London councils

This aligns with the global trend of 58% of ransomware campaigns involving third-party software compromise.

## Trends & Analysis

### Critical Infrastructure Vulnerabilities

November demonstrated that European critical infrastructure remains a prime target. The attacks on Swedish municipal services, Italian rail systems, and London local government services highlight the vulnerability of essential services to cyber attacks.

### Supply-Chain Concentration Risk

The Miljödata and Almaviva incidents underscore the risks of IT consolidation in public services. When a single provider serves multiple municipalities or critical infrastructure operators, a single breach can have cascading effects across wide geographic areas and populations.

### Unpatched Vulnerabilities

The Eurofiber breach through an unpatched GLPI system demonstrates the ongoing challenge of vulnerability management. SQL injection, a well-known attack vector, succeeded due to inadequate patching practices.

### Coordinated Attacks

The simultaneous targeting of three London councils sharing IT infrastructure suggests increasingly sophisticated attackers capable of exploiting shared services architecture. This incident may represent either a single coordinated attack or multiple threat actors exploiting common vulnerabilities.

### Response and Resilience

European organizations demonstrated improved incident response capabilities:
- Swift activation of emergency plans (London councils)
- Coordination with national cyber agencies (NCSC, NCA)
- Transparent public communication about incidents
- Isolation of affected systems to prevent spread

## Looking Ahead

November's incidents in Europe highlight several priorities for 2026:

1. **Third-Party Risk Management:** Organizations must strengthen oversight of suppliers and service providers
2. **Patch Management:** Critical systems require faster vulnerability remediation
3. **Shared Infrastructure Security:** Consolidated IT services need enhanced segmentation and monitoring
4. **Incident Response:** Continued investment in detection and response capabilities
5. **Cross-Border Coordination:** Enhanced information sharing across EU member states
