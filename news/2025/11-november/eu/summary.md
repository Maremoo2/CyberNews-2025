# November 2025 - European Union Summary

## Overview

November 2025 saw the European Union face a significant wave of cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure, municipal services, and transportation systems. The month was characterized by large-scale supply-chain compromises affecting millions of individuals, ransomware attacks on essential services, and coordinated intrusions on shared government IT infrastructure.

The attacks demonstrated increasing sophistication in targeting consolidated IT service providers, exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in widely-used systems, and leveraging supply-chain relationships to maximize impact. Four major incidents dominated the month's cyber landscape, collectively affecting over 2 million individuals and countless businesses.

## Key Trends

### Supply-Chain Concentration Risk

November starkly illustrated the dangers of IT service consolidation in public sector operations. The Miljödata breach in Sweden affected residents of approximately 200 municipalities through a single compromise, demonstrating how shared service models can amplify the impact of successful attacks. Similarly, the Almaviva breach exposed Italy's national rail operator to significant data loss through a third-party IT contractor.

### Critical Infrastructure Targeting

Attackers showed a clear preference for critical infrastructure and essential services:
- **Municipal Services:** 1.5 million Swedes affected through Miljödata
- **Transportation:** Italy's national rail logistics and financial data compromised
- **Telecommunications:** 10,000 Eurofiber business customers impacted
- **Local Government:** Over 500,000 London residents' services disrupted

### Unpatched Vulnerabilities

The Eurofiber incident demonstrated that even well-known attack vectors like SQL injection remain effective when organizations fail to maintain adequate patch management practices. The breach exploited an unpatched GLPI system, a widely-used open-source IT management platform.

### Coordinated Attacks on Shared Infrastructure

The London councils incident revealed sophisticated targeting of shared IT infrastructure. Three councils using common systems experienced simultaneous cyber incidents, suggesting either a coordinated attack or multiple threat actors exploiting architectural weaknesses in consolidated service delivery.

### Silent Data Exfiltration

European incidents followed the global trend toward data exfiltration without immediate encryption. Groups like ByteToBreach focused on stealing data for extortion rather than deploying ransomware, making detection more challenging and response more complex.

## Impact Assessment

### Human Impact
- **~1.5 million individuals** in Sweden had personal data stolen (names, medical records, school records)
- **~500,000+ residents** in London experienced service disruptions
- **~10,000 business customers** of Eurofiber France had sensitive data compromised

### Operational Impact
- **Municipal services** disrupted across 200 Swedish municipalities
- **Local government services** shut down (tax, parking, social care) in three London councils
- **Rail operations** potentially affected through Almaviva supply-chain compromise
- **Telecommunications** infrastructure data exposed through Eurofiber breach

### Data Exposure
- **~2.3 TB** of rail infrastructure data stolen from Almaviva
- **Medical and school records** for 1.5 million Swedes posted online
- **VPN configurations, credentials, API keys, tokens** stolen from Eurofiber
- **Financial and logistics data** for Italy's national rail operator compromised

## Regulatory Response

### EU Digital Omnibus

The European Commission's November 19 proposal for the Digital Omnibus Regulation represents a significant policy response to the growing complexity of cybersecurity requirements. The regulation aims to:
- Streamline incident reporting across multiple directives
- Improve data sharing for threat intelligence
- Integrate AI governance with cybersecurity requirements
- Reduce regulatory burden while maintaining security standards

### NIS2 Implementation

November's incidents underscore the importance of NIS2 directive implementation. The requirement for 24-hour initial incident notifications and 72-hour full reports would have ensured faster response to incidents like the London councils attack. Enhanced security requirements for essential service providers align directly with vulnerabilities exposed in the Miljödata and Almaviva incidents.

### National Responses

Individual member states demonstrated strong incident response:
- **Sweden:** DPA investigation into Miljödata breach
- **UK:** NCSC and NCA immediately engaged on London councils incident
- **France:** Regulatory oversight of Eurofiber breach investigation
- **Italy:** Coordination on Almaviva supply-chain compromise

## Looking Ahead

November's incidents provide clear lessons for European cybersecurity priorities:

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Third-Party Risk Management:** Enhanced due diligence and continuous monitoring of IT service providers
2. **Patch Management:** Accelerated vulnerability remediation, especially for internet-facing systems
3. **Network Segmentation:** Better isolation between shared infrastructure tenants
4. **Incident Detection:** Improved monitoring for data exfiltration without encryption

### Strategic Priorities
1. **Supply-Chain Security:** Strengthen requirements for third-party security assessments
2. **Shared Services Architecture:** Design patterns that limit blast radius of compromises
3. **Cross-Border Coordination:** Leverage Cyber Solidarity Act for mutual assistance
4. **Resilience Planning:** Ensure essential services can continue during cyber incidents

### Policy Development
1. **Digital Omnibus:** Support streamlined reporting while maintaining security rigor
2. **NIS2 Enforcement:** Accelerate implementation and compliance verification
3. **Critical Infrastructure:** Enhanced protections for consolidated service providers
4. **Cyber Resilience Act:** Progress technical standards for software security

## Sector-Specific Insights

### Public Sector
Municipal and local government services remain high-value targets. The consolidation of IT services across multiple government entities creates efficiency but also concentrates risk. November demonstrated the need for:
- Defense-in-depth strategies for shared infrastructure
- Regular security assessments of multi-tenant architectures
- Incident response plans that account for simultaneous multi-organization impact
- Communication protocols for coordinated public messaging

### Transportation
The Almaviva breach highlighted supply-chain risks in critical transportation infrastructure. Rail systems, airports, and maritime facilities rely on IT contractors who may hold sensitive operational data. Enhanced third-party security requirements are essential for this sector.

### Telecommunications
The Eurofiber breach demonstrated that telecommunications providers face sophisticated attacks exploiting common vulnerabilities. The exposure of VPN configurations and credentials creates cascading risks for customers. This sector requires:
- Rigorous vulnerability management programs
- Network segmentation to limit credential compromise impact
- Enhanced monitoring for unusual data access patterns

### Healthcare and Education
The exposure of medical and school records in the Miljödata breach affects individuals for years to come. These sectors require special protections:
- Enhanced encryption for sensitive personal data
- Strict access controls and audit logging
- Regular security awareness training
- Incident response plans that prioritize individual notification

## Conclusion

November 2025 marked a significant month for European cybersecurity, with major incidents exposing vulnerabilities in consolidated IT services, supply-chain security, and critical infrastructure protection. The 1.5 million individuals affected by the Miljödata breach, the disruption of services to 500,000+ London residents, and the compromise of national rail infrastructure data demonstrate the real-world impact of cyber attacks on European citizens and essential services.

The European Commission's Digital Omnibus proposal, coupled with ongoing NIS2 implementation, provides a policy framework for addressing these challenges. However, November's incidents demonstrate that regulatory requirements must be matched with robust technical security practices, especially in supply-chain management, vulnerability remediation, and incident detection.

As Europe continues to digitalize public services and critical infrastructure, the lessons of November 2025 underscore the importance of balancing efficiency gains from IT consolidation with the security requirements necessary to protect citizens, businesses, and essential services from sophisticated cyber threats.
