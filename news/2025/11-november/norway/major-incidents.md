# November 2025 - Norway Major Incidents

## Major Incidents

### November 4 – Ruter Public Transport

- **Date:** November 4, 2025
- **Target:** Ruter (Oslo-area transit operator)
- **Attack Type:** Hardware supply-chain audit / Security discovery
- **Impact:** Hidden SIM cards found in Chinese-built electric buses; potential remote access capability
- **Attribution:** Yutong (Chinese bus manufacturer) - unintentional or intentional unknown
- **Details:** Oslo-area transit operator Ruter discovered hidden SIM cards in Yutong electric buses during a routine hardware supply-chain audit. The SIM cards (cellular modems) were not disclosed in the original specifications and could theoretically allow remote access by the manufacturer or other parties.

  **Discovery and Response:**
  - Ruter conducted comprehensive hardware audits of newly-delivered buses
  - Found undisclosed cellular modems with active SIM cards
  - SIMs had potential for remote communication with buses' control systems
  - Ruter immediately removed all discovered SIM cards
  - Initiated review of procurement and network security controls

  **Security Implications:**
  The hidden modems raised several concerns:
  - **Remote Access:** Potential for manufacturer or third parties to access bus systems remotely
  - **Data Exfiltration:** Possible monitoring of location, operations, passenger data
  - **Control Systems:** Risk of unauthorized interference with bus operations
  - **Supply Chain Trust:** Questions about verification of imported technology
  - **Critical Infrastructure:** Public transit systems are classified as critical infrastructure in Norway

  **Government Response:**
  Norway's Transport Minister stated the case highlights the need to vet foreign technology suppliers in critical systems. The incident prompted:
  - Review of all foreign technology in critical infrastructure
  - Enhanced procurement requirements for technology verification
  - Network security controls to prevent unauthorized external access
  - Consideration of security requirements in public procurement

  **Broader Context:**
  This incident reflects growing global concerns about:
  - Chinese technology in critical infrastructure (5G networks, transportation, utilities)
  - Supply chain security in hardware procurement
  - Verification and audit capabilities for complex systems
  - Balance between cost efficiency and security in public procurement

  **International Parallels:**
  Similar concerns have emerged in other countries:
  - UK banned Huawei from 5G networks
  - US restrictions on Chinese technology in critical infrastructure
  - EU discussions about supply chain security requirements
  - Australia's critical infrastructure legislation

  **Ruter's Actions:**
  - Removed all hidden SIM cards from affected buses
  - Implemented enhanced network segmentation
  - Restricted external network access to bus systems
  - Revised procurement contracts to explicitly prohibit undisclosed hardware
  - Increased hardware verification in acceptance testing
  - Working with Norwegian NSM on security protocols

  Norway's approach demonstrates proactive security measures rather than reactive breach response. The discovery during an audit prevented potential future exploitation.

## Conclusion

November 2025 demonstrated Norway's proactive and mature approach to cybersecurity. Rather than responding to major breaches, Norway focused on prevention through supply chain security audits (Ruter) and preparedness through large-scale exercises (Øvelse Digital).

The Ruter incident showcases the importance of verification and vigilance in supply chain security. The discovery of hidden SIM cards in Chinese-built buses could have enabled remote access and monitoring, potentially compromising a critical public transportation system. Ruter's proactive audit detected this risk before exploitation, and swift action mitigated the threat.

Øvelse Digital represents Norway's commitment to national cyber resilience. With approximately 60 agencies and companies participating in coordinated scenarios, the exercise tested detection, response coordination, and continuity of essential services across multiple critical sectors. This builds capability before incidents occur and strengthens the relationships necessary for effective crisis response.

The absence of major public breaches in Norway during November—while the US experienced 356 ransomware attacks—reflects several factors: smaller market size, high baseline security, effective prevention, and strong public-private coordination. However, Norwegian organizations remain vigilant, knowing that threats persist and that continued investment in cybersecurity is essential.

As Norway implements EU NIS2 directive-aligned regulations, enhances supply chain security requirements, and continues its exercise program, the foundations laid in November 2025 will strengthen national cyber resilience for years to come. The proactive stance demonstrated through hardware audits and national exercises positions Norway well to face the evolving cyber threat landscape of 2026 and beyond.
