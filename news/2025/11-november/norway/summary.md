## Conclusion

November 2025 represents a model month for Norwegian cybersecurity: proactive discovery of supply chain risks through the Ruter hardware audit, and demonstrated national preparedness through Øvelse Digital. While other countries responded to major breaches affecting millions of individuals, Norway focused on prevention and preparedness.

The Ruter incident demonstrates that even advanced nations must remain vigilant about supply chain security. The discovery of hidden SIM cards in Chinese-built buses could have enabled remote access and monitoring of critical public transportation infrastructure. Ruter's proactive audit detected this risk before exploitation, and swift response mitigated the threat. This incident will inform Norwegian procurement policy for years to come.

Øvelse Digital showcased Norway's commitment to national cyber resilience. With approximately 60 agencies and companies practicing coordinated response to cyber attacks across multiple sectors, the exercise built capabilities and relationships essential for effective crisis management. In a world where cyber incidents are inevitable, the ability to detect, respond, and recover quickly differentiates resilient nations from vulnerable ones.

The absence of major cyber breaches in Norway during November—while the US experienced 356 ransomware attacks and European countries faced multiple major incidents—reflects Norway's cybersecurity maturity. However, Norwegian authorities recognize that threats persist, particularly from state-sponsored actors like Russia. Nearly 50% of critical infrastructure entities experience probing or minor incidents annually, demonstrating continuous pressure.

As Norway moves toward 2026, the foundations established in November will serve the nation well: enhanced supply chain security awareness, exercised coordination mechanisms, strong public-private partnerships under NSM leadership, and alignment with international standards like EU NIS2. These elements position Norway to maintain its strong cybersecurity posture in an increasingly challenging threat environment.

The proactive stance demonstrated through hardware audits and national exercises represents a model that other nations would do well to emulate. Prevention is more effective than response, preparedness is more valuable than reaction, and coordination built before crises functions better during them. Norway's November 2025 exemplifies these principles in practice.
