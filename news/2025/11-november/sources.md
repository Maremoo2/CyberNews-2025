## Verification and Credibility

All sources cited in the November 2025 cybersecurity news reports meet the following criteria:

**Authoritative Sources:**
- Government agencies (NSM, US Treasury, European Commission)
- Regulatory authorities (FINRA)
- Established news organizations (The Guardian, Reuters)
- Specialized cybersecurity publications (SecurityWeek, Cybernews)
- Threat intelligence firms (Cyble, ASEC AhnLab, FireCompass)
- Academic institutions (Harvard Magazine)

**Verification Standards:**
- Primary sources used wherever possible
- Multiple source corroboration for major incidents
- Direct quotes and specific data points included
- Dates and technical details verified
- Attribution clearly stated

**Transparency:**
- All sources explicitly cited in incident reports
- URLs provided for reference
- Uncertainty noted where information is incomplete
- "Unknown" attribution when threat actors unidentified

## Additional Context

### Why These Sources?

**Cyble.com** is extensively cited because it provides the most comprehensive ransomware tracking data, with monthly reports covering hundreds of incidents globally.

**SecurityWeek.com** offers detailed technical reporting on enterprise security incidents with good source verification and technical detail.

**Government sources** (NSM.no, home.treasury.gov, digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu) provide authoritative information on policy, regulations, and official responses.

**Specialized threat intelligence** (ASEC AhnLab, FireCompass, Halborn) offers deep technical analysis of specific attack campaigns and vulnerabilities.

**Mainstream news** (The Guardian, Reuters) provides verified reporting with editorial oversight and broader context.

### Source Limitations

**Delayed Reporting:** Some incidents are reported weeks or months after occurrence (e.g., Cox Enterprises breach occurred August 9-14 but reported in November).

**Incomplete Information:** Many incidents lack complete attribution or technical details due to ongoing investigations or organizational disclosure practices.

**Geographic Bias:** English-language sources may underrepresent incidents in non-English-speaking countries.

**Commercial Sources:** Some threat intelligence comes from commercial vendors who may have incentives to emphasize certain threats.

Despite these limitations, the combination of government, academic, news, and specialized sources provides a robust and balanced view of November 2025's cybersecurity landscape.
