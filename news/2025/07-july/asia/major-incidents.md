# July 2025 - Asia Major Incidents

## Regional Cyber Threats Overview

Cyber threat activity in Asia during July 2025 remained high, driven by both nation-state actors and cybercriminal groups. State-sponsored espionage was a key concern, with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups conducting cyber-espionage against critical infrastructure sectors across the region. Sectors like telecom, energy, and government agencies faced stealthy intrusions aimed at stealing sensitive data, described by officials as serious national security risks.

North Korean hacking campaigns continued unabated, with state-backed cyber units (like the Lazarus Group) having stolen over $2 billion in cryptocurrency through years of exchange hacks and DeFi exploits. In 2025 alone, these groups were behind major crypto heists, persisting into July as they sought out new DeFi platform vulnerabilities and conducted social engineering attacks on crypto firms.

## Major Incidents

### July 18, 2025 – Chinese APT SharePoint Exploit Campaign

- **Date:** July 18, 2025 (reported)
- **Target:** U.S. and regional networks globally; SharePoint servers
- **Attack Type:** Zero-day vulnerability exploitation for espionage and ransomware
- **Impact:** 75-100 organizations compromised across multiple continents
- **Attribution:** Chinese state-sponsored hackers (Microsoft dubbed them Linen Typhoon/Violet Typhoon)
- **Details:** Although global in scope, a significant portion of the SharePoint zero-day attacks was attributed to Chinese state-sponsored hackers. These actors not only breached U.S. agencies but also likely scanned for vulnerable SharePoint servers in Asia. By exploiting the flaw for espionage, then pivoting to ransomware deployment, they blurred the line between nation-state spying and cybercrime. Dozens of organizations across multiple continents were compromised; in Asia, any entity running on-premise SharePoint without patches was at risk. This incident underlined China's expansive cyber operations, affecting not just Western targets but any globally connected networks. China's Foreign Ministry was questioned about the attribution.

### Mid-July 2025 – Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)

- **Date:** Mid-July 2025
- **Target:** Indian Council of Agricultural Research (India's premier agriculture R&D organization)
- **Attack Type:** Data breach affecting research and recruitment
- **Impact:** Disrupted recruitment processes and research projects across multiple ICAR institutes
- **Attribution:** Not immediately known; motives could range from hacktivism to state-sponsored
- **Details:** ICAR, India's premier agriculture R&D organization, was hit by a cyberattack that led to a major data breach and IT outages. The attack disrupted key recruitment processes and research projects across multiple ICAR institutes. It likely exposed sensitive data related to research and personnel (details were not fully disclosed publicly). Systems were taken offline as a precaution, hampering day-to-day operations. Given the nature of the target, motives could range from hacktivism to state-sponsored espionage aimed at stealing agricultural research.

### July 17, 2025 – Lazarus Group Cryptocurrency Heists (BigONE)

- **Date:** Ongoing 2025; notable BigONE exchange breach on July 17
- **Target:** Cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms
- **Attack Type:** Series of crypto exchange hacks
- **Impact:** $27 million stolen in BigONE breach; over $2 billion cumulative by late 2025
- **Attribution:** North Korean state-backed hackers (Lazarus Group)
- **Details:** Through the first half of 2025 (including July), North Korea's Lazarus Group and affiliated units carried out a string of hacks against cryptocurrency platforms, stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. One notable case around July was the BigONE exchange breach on July 17, where $27 million in crypto was stolen via a third-party platform vulnerability. Users of the affected exchanges suffered losses (though in BigONE's case, the hacker oddly returned most funds for a "bounty"). Cumulatively, by late 2025, over $2 billion was estimated stolen by North Korean hackers. The revenue supports North Korea's regime amid sanctions. North Korean state-backed hackers (Lazarus) are strongly suspected in these attacks, given tactics and prior attributions.

### July 2025 – Singapore Critical Infrastructure APT

- **Date:** July 2025 (disclosed)
- **Target:** Singapore's critical infrastructure sectors (telecom, energy, government agencies)
- **Attack Type:** State-sponsored cyber-espionage
- **Impact:** Stealthy intrusions aimed at stealing sensitive data
- **Attribution:** Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, believed state-sponsored
- **Details:** Singapore's government disclosed that an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, believed state-sponsored, conducted cyber-espionage against Singapore's critical infrastructure sectors. Sectors like telecom, energy, and government agencies in Singapore faced stealthy intrusions aimed at stealing sensitive data, described by officials as a serious national security risk. The campaign demonstrated sophisticated techniques and persistence characteristic of nation-state operations.

### Ongoing July 2025 – Critical Infrastructure Espionage (Japan and South Korea)

- **Target:** Japanese and South Korean government agencies, nuclear research facilities, defense contractors
- **Attack Type:** Multi-vector intrusions (phishing, supply-chain, cloud platform exploits)
- **Attribution:** Chinese and Russian APTs (Japan); North Korean units (South Korea)
- **Details:** While specific July incidents in Japan and ROK were not widely publicized, intelligence assessments indicated that both countries faced intensified cyber spying. In Japan, government agencies noted multi-vector intrusions (phishing, supply-chain, and cloud platform exploits) likely by Chinese and Russian APTs. In South Korea, security services in July flagged continuous attempts to breach nuclear research facilities and defense contractors, presumably by North Korean units. Media later revealed that South Korea's largest insurer (SGI) was hit by a cyberattack in July, claimed by a hacker group called Gunrar – exposing personal data of policyholders (the government launched an inquiry). These incidents highlight that Asia's largest economies are under constant cyber siege, driving them to bolster defenses.
