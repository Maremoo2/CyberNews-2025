# July 2025 - Norway Major Incidents

## National Cyber Incidents

### April 7, 2025 (Disclosed July) – Breach of Norwegian Dam Control Systems

- **Date:** Attack occurred April 7, 2025; disclosed to public in July 2025
- **Target:** Lake Risevatnet dam (near Svelgen, Bremanger, western Norway)
- **Attack Type:** Critical infrastructure cyberattack via weak password
- **Impact:** Dam's water discharge valves opened to maximum for 4 hours
- **Attribution:** Pro-Russian hackers (confirmed by Norwegian authorities in August)

#### Attack Details

**Discovery and Timeline:**
- **April 7, 2025:** Attackers opened the dam's water discharge valves to maximum
- **Duration:** Valves remained fully open for 4 hours before detection
- **Detection:** Dam's owner, Breivika Eiendom, detected abnormal activity on April 7
- **Reporting:** Incident reported to Norwegian cybersecurity authorities (NSM, NVE, Kripos) on April 10
- **Public Disclosure:** July 2025

**Technical Details:**
- **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of weak password on dam's web-based SCADA control interface
- **Access Method:** Remote unauthorized access to operational technology (OT) system
- **Water Discharge:** Valves opened to maximum, allowing excess water flow
- **Impact:** Fortunately, no damage – downstream river absorbed extra water and no flooding occurred

**Attribution Process:**
- **Initial Investigation:** Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) and National Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos) led investigation
- **June 2025:** Kripos reached conclusion after reviewing videos posted by Russian hacktivists on Telegram demonstrating their intrusion
- **August 2025:** Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) formally attributed attack to pro-Russian hackers
- **Context:** Described as part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy aimed at causing harm and showcasing capability
- **Intent:** PST stated the aim was "to influence and to cause fear and chaos among the general population"

**Significance:**
- First official linkage by Oslo of cyberattack to Russia
- Demonstrated vulnerability of critical infrastructure with weak security controls
- Highlighted risks of OT systems lacking proper safeguards (strong passwords, MFA)
- Showed that even "simple" attacks can have serious implications for critical infrastructure

### Additional Incidents Under Investigation

**Other Similar Attack:**
Norwegian authorities indicated another similar hacker attack was under investigation in mid-2025, though details were not made public. Kripos confirmed they were examining a second incident with similar characteristics.

**Low-Grade Cyber Activity:**
Norway experienced ongoing low-grade cyber activity throughout 2025, often attributed to Russian hacker forums:
- Denial-of-service attacks on private and public sector websites
- Attempted intrusions into ministry networks
- None causing major damage in July, but contributing to heightened threat assessment

### Other Corporate Incidents

**Municipal IT Provider Attack:**
Local news reported an attack on a municipal IT provider that briefly disrupted services in several Norwegian towns. Suspected to be criminal hackers seeking ransom. Details limited due to ongoing investigation.

**Norsk Hydro Thwarted Intrusion:**
Norsk Hydro (which suffered major ransomware attack in 2019) revealed it successfully thwarted a new phishing-based intrusion attempt in July 2025, thanks to improved monitoring. Demonstrated value of lessons learned from previous incidents.

These cases, though limited in impact, reinforced need for vigilance even among companies that had already invested in cybersecurity.
