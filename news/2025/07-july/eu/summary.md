# July 2025 - European Union Summary

## Overview

July 2025 was a challenging month for EU cybersecurity, with major data breaches affecting millions of citizens across multiple member states. From France's national employment agency to luxury retailers, healthcare networks, defense contractors, and telecommunications giants, the breadth of targets demonstrated that cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors are equally willing to attack both public and private sectors.

The month was characterized by sophisticated supply-chain attacks, third-party vendor compromises, and the continued targeting of critical infrastructure. Several incidents involved extortion groups like ShinyHunters and Rhysida, while others appeared to be nation-state operations focused on espionage or hybrid warfare.

## Key Trends

### Supply-Chain and Third-Party Risk

Multiple major breaches in July stemmed from compromised third-party vendors:

- **France Travail:** Training partner's platform breached via infostealer malware
- **Orange S.A.:** Third-party email service provider compromised
- **European Airports:** Collins Aerospace MUSE system ransomware affecting multiple airports

These incidents underscore the critical importance of vendor security assessments and continuous monitoring of third-party access to sensitive systems.

### Cross-Border Impact

Several attacks demonstrated the pan-European nature of modern cyber threats:

- **Louis Vuitton:** Single attack compromising customer data across UK, Italy, Sweden, and Turkey
- **Affidea:** Healthcare network attack disrupting medical services in multiple EU countries
- **European Airports:** Ransomware affecting operations at Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin

The interconnected nature of EU business operations means a single breach can rapidly affect multiple member states.

### Critical Sectors Under Siege

July saw targeted attacks on sectors vital to European security and society:

- **Defense:** Naval Group's 1 TB data leak exposing submarine and warship designs
- **Healthcare:** Affidea's clinical systems forced offline across multiple nations
- **Justice:** International Criminal Court sophisticated breach
- **Telecommunications:** Both Orange and Telefónica compromised

These incidents highlight the strategic targeting of infrastructure that underpins European sovereignty and citizen welfare.

## New EU Regulations and Initiatives

### NIS2 Directive Implementation Guidance

In July, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) published technical guidelines to support implementation of the new NIS2 Directive. These guidelines provide EU companies in critical sectors (energy, transport, health, finance, etc.) with best practices on:

- Risk management
- Incident handling
- Business continuity
- Supply chain security

As the NIS2 Directive came into force at the end of 2024, the July 2025 guidance helps harmonize cybersecurity measures across Member States. The timing was particularly relevant given the month's high-profile supply-chain attacks.

### EU Condemnation of Russian Cyber Activities

On 18 July 2025, the EU's High Representative issued a formal statement condemning persistent malicious cyber campaigns by Russia. The statement:

- Decried a pattern of coordinated Russian hybrid operations including disinformation and cyberattacks
- Aimed at undermining European security
- Warned that Russian cyber aggression had escalated since the war in Ukraine
- Vowed the EU would use all available tools to deter, defend against, and respond to such threats

This followed the EU's expansion of sanctions in 2025 against individuals and entities involved in Russian information manipulation and cyberattacks. The Council sanctioned twelve individuals and two entities over these activities.

### AI and Data Regulation Developments

In late July, the European Commission released significant AI governance frameworks:

**Code of Practice for GPAI Models:**
A voluntary and non-binding code designed to help General Purpose AI (GPAI) model providers demonstrate compliance with their obligations under the EU AI Act. While focused on AI compliance, these measures intersect with cybersecurity by encouraging transparency and risk management for AI systems.

**Guidelines on GPAI Obligations:**
Final guidelines setting out the Commission's interpretation and application of the AI Act, which will guide enforcement actions.

These developments are part of the EU's broader strategy to ensure AI systems are developed and deployed securely.

### Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) — an EU regulation to bolster financial-sector cyber resilience — became applicable in July 2025. Norway also implemented DORA in July, signaling the EU's regulatory push for stronger cyber defenses in finance. DORA requires:

- Robust ICT risk management frameworks
- Continuous monitoring and vulnerability assessments
- Major ICT-related incident reporting
- Regular digital resilience testing
- Assessment and monitoring of third-party ICT service providers

## Response and Resilience

### ENISA's Role

The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) played a crucial role in July:

- Published NIS2 implementation guidelines
- Confirmed ransomware as the cause of European airport disruptions
- Coordinated response to cross-border incidents
- Facilitated information sharing among member states

### Law Enforcement Cooperation

Multiple incidents triggered international law enforcement cooperation:

- **ICC breach:** Investigation launched with support from multiple EU agencies
- **Airport ransomware:** Pan-European law enforcement probes opened
- **Naval Group leak:** French authorities investigation with Europol coordination

### Industry Response

Organizations demonstrated varying levels of preparedness:

- **Welthungerhilfe:** Refused to pay ransom, working with investigators
- **Louis Vuitton:** Rapid disclosure and coordination across affected regions
- **Affidea:** Precautionary system shutdown to prevent further spread

## Recommendations for EU Organizations

Based on July's incidents, EU cybersecurity experts emphasize:

1. **Vendor Risk Management:** Implement rigorous third-party security assessments and continuous monitoring
2. **Cross-Border Coordination:** Establish incident response procedures that account for multi-country operations
3. **NIS2 Compliance:** Accelerate implementation of NIS2 requirements, particularly for supply chain security
4. **DORA Implementation:** Financial sector entities should prioritize digital operational resilience frameworks
5. **Defense in Depth:** Deploy multiple layers of security controls, including MFA, network segmentation, and behavioral analytics
6. **Incident Response Planning:** Ensure response plans account for supply-chain attacks and cross-border implications

## Looking Ahead

The diversity and sophistication of July's attacks indicate that EU organizations must maintain heightened vigilance. The regulatory framework is strengthening with NIS2 and DORA, but implementation and enforcement will be critical. The EU's public condemnation of Russian cyber activities signals a more assertive stance, but the threat landscape remains complex with both nation-state and criminal actors actively targeting European interests.
