# April 2025 - Norway Major Incidents

## Major Incidents

### April 7 – Bremanger Hydroelectric Dam Sabotage

- **Date:** April 7, 2025
- **Target:** Bremanger hydroelectric dam (western Norway)
- **Attack Type:** Cyber-physical sabotage
- **Impact:** Floodgate opened remotely; 500 liters of water per second released for ~4 hours; no injuries or serious damage
- **Attribution:** Russian-aligned hackers (pro-Russian threat actors) - confirmed by PST
- **Details:** In a landmark cyber-physical attack, Russian-aligned hackers briefly took control of a dam's control systems in Bremanger, western Norway. The attackers opened a floodgate remotely, releasing 500 liters of water per second for about four hours before operators detected and stopped the breach.

  Fortunately, no injuries or serious damage were reported, as the dam (used mainly for fish farming and power regulation) did not overflow dangerously. Norwegian authorities later confirmed the attack was an act of sabotage by pro-Russian threat actors amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

  This April 7 incident is one of the most significant cyber attacks on Norwegian critical infrastructure to date, demonstrating the potential for hackers to induce real-world kinetic effects. Norway's Police Security Service (PST) publicly blamed Russia-backed actors for this operation.

### Context: No Other Major Public Incidents

No other major incidents were publicly reported in Norway during April 2025 of comparable scale to the dam event. Other Norwegian organizations did not disclose large breaches in April, making the Bremanger dam case the central focus.

## Trends & Analysis

### State-Sponsored Threat Escalation

The dam sabotage was a wake-up call illustrating that Norway's critical infrastructure – especially its energy and utilities sectors – faces serious cyber risks. Norway generates most of its electricity from hydropower dams, and officials had long warned that these could be targets. April proved those warnings justified.

The PST noted in an April briefing: *"Over the past year, we have seen a change in activity from pro-Russian cyber actors. Norway's Russian neighbour is becoming more dangerous in the cyber domain."*

The goal of operations like the dam hack is to sow fear and chaos among the population as retaliation for Norway's support of Ukraine. This marks a shift from nuisance-level DDoS attacks (which Norway experienced in 2022-2023) to more impactful sabotage attempts in 2025.

### Private Sector Impact

Norwegian companies likely benefited from the relative size of the market (not as attractive to big ransomware gangs) and possibly good security practices in critical industries. However, Norwegian entities were not completely unscathed by global events:

- **Hertz breach:** Affected Norwegian customers of Hertz rental car services (driver's license and payment data theft)
- **Small SMEs:** A few Norwegian SMEs appeared on ransomware leak sites in April (e.g., a small Oslo-based manufacturing firm listed by a ransomware gang with less than 50 GB of data stolen)

### Preparedness and Response

After the dam incident, Norwegian authorities and companies began reviewing their incident response and disaster recovery plans. Key actions included:

- **Heightened interest** in conducting tabletop exercises simulating cyber-physical attacks
- **Dam operator** (likely Statkraft) immediately audited all dam control system access and passwords nationwide
- **NATO involvement:** NATO's cyber center was briefed on the dam attack
- **Nordic collaboration:** Nordic countries collaboratively raised their cyber alert levels in late April due to fears of further Russian reprisals

### Public Awareness

The dam hack story was covered widely in Norwegian media in April, making cybersecurity a kitchen-table topic. The narrative shifted from "cyber attacks cause data loss" to "cyber attacks can cause real damage."

This is likely to influence how Norwegian organizations invest in security going forward, with more attention to operational technology (OT) security, not just IT. The PST and NSM both urged critical industries to harden their systems and practice incident scenarios where IT and OT are impacted simultaneously.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### National Security Measures

In April, though no new cybersecurity law was passed, the Norwegian government took steps under existing frameworks to fortify defenses:

**Joint Review Directive:**
- Ministry of Justice and Public Security tasked the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) and NSM to conduct a joint review of cyber safeguards at all major dams and power plants
- Administrative directive (not legislation) aimed at identifying gaps and enforcing stricter access controls and monitoring in critical infrastructure
- NSM indicated it may utilize its authority under the Security Act to issue updated security requirements to CI operators later in the year

### International Attribution & Diplomacy

Norway in April continued to coordinate with allies on attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Behind closed doors, Norway's foreign ministry was preparing diplomatic responses and considering invoking NATO Article 5's consultation mechanism if further critical attacks occurred.

The PST's public statement in April attributing the dam incident to Russian actors (even without naming a specific unit) was itself a policy decision to raise public awareness and deterrence. The Russian Embassy's swift denial and accusation of politicization underscored the diplomatic friction such attributions cause.

### EU Alignment

Norway, though not an EU member, often mirrors EU regulations. In April, Norwegian lawmakers discussed the timeline for updating Norway's laws in line with the EU NIS2 directive and the Cyber Security Act.

**Plans included:**
- Introducing amendments to Norway's Security Act and eCom regulations
- Incorporating similar incident reporting duties and supplier security requirements as NIS2
- Requiring cloud providers serving critical Norwegian sectors to report incidents within 24 hours

While these legislative changes were still in draft, April's events likely accelerated their consideration.

### Public-Private Collaboration

NSM hosted an extraordinary meeting in late April with operators of critical infrastructure (energy, telecom, transport) to:
- Share threat intelligence about Russian cyber groups
- Ensure contingency plans were up to date
- Promote use of the national Cyber Coordination Center (NorCERT) for real-time alerts

Additionally, Norway's National Communications Authority (NKOM) in April proposed new rules requiring telecom providers to secure critical network equipment, including vetting suppliers for 5G networks.

## Statistics

### Incident Count

Norway typically has a lower volume of cyber incidents compared to larger countries, but April saw one "significant" incident (the dam) and a handful of lesser incidents. The Norwegian National Cybersecurity Centre (NorCERT) does not publish monthly numbers publicly.

For context, in 2024 NorCERT handled approximately 200 serious incidents nationwide; for 2025 that number is expected to rise. April 2025 likely contributed a few to that tally, with the dam sabotage being the standout.

### Critical Infrastructure Targeting

By April's end, Norway had recorded at least 2 known cyber events targeting infrastructure in 2025:
1. The Bremanger dam (April)
2. An attempted cyber attack on satellite communications used by the petroleum sector (disclosed in January)

Norwegian authorities have warned that nearly 50% of monitored national critical infrastructure entities saw some form of probing or minor cyber incident in the past year – suggesting that while only one major incident occurred in April, many systems are being regularly tested by threat actors.

### Ransomware/Data Breaches

In April, no Norwegian organizations reported breaches affecting >10k individuals. Small incidents occurred (e.g., a regional healthcare trust had a phishing case exposing a few hundred records), but nothing on the scale of millions.

However, Norwegian people were indirectly part of larger breaches:
- Hertz's breach affected Norwegian customers
- Global Mailchimp/PoisonSeed phishing likely reached Norwegian inboxes
- Yale hospital breach and Blue Shield breach may have involved a few hundred Norwegian citizens (visitors/policyholders)

### Economic Impact

The immediate economic impact of April's dam sabotage is difficult to quantify (no direct damage reported), but Norway's hydro dams supply ~90% of its power. A successful cyber-induced outage could cost millions per day.

**Expert estimate:** If the April 7 attack had caused a major grid imbalance, it might have triggered costs of NOK 10-20 million in grid regulation fees.

**Defensive spending:** Norway announced it would allocate an extra NOK 200 million (≈$20M) to cyber defense of critical sectors in the revised national budget – a direct response to the heightened threat, implicitly justified by April's incident.

### Public Sentiment

A poll in late April by a Norwegian news outlet found that:
- **68% of Norwegians** had heard about the dam cyberattack
- Among those, **over 70% expressed worry** about future attacks on critical services
- Cybersecurity **jumped into the top five security concerns** in Norway for 2025

Before April, cybersecurity ranked relatively low on public issue surveys. This change in public perception is a measurable outcome of April's events for Norway.
