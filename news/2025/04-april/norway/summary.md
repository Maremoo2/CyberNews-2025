# April 2025 - Norway Summary

## Overview

The cyber threat landscape in Norway during April was dominated by concerns over state-sponsored attacks, particularly from Russia. The Bremanger hydroelectric dam sabotage on April 7 was a landmark cyber-physical attack that demonstrated Norway's critical infrastructure – especially its energy and utilities sectors – faces serious cyber risks. This incident proved warnings that Norway's hydropower dams could be targets were justified.

## Key Trends

### State-Sponsored Attacks

The PST (Norwegian Security Service) noted in an April briefing that over the past year they've observed a "change in activity from pro-Russian cyber actors," with Norway's "Russian neighbour becoming more dangerous" in the cyber domain. The goal of operations like the dam hack is to sow fear and chaos among the population as retaliation for Norway's support of Ukraine.

This marks a shift from nuisance-level DDoS attacks (which Norway experienced in 2022-2023) to more impactful sabotage attempts in 2025.

### Preparedness and Resilience Focus

After the dam incident, Norwegian authorities and companies began reviewing their incident response and disaster recovery plans. There was heightened interest in conducting tabletop exercises simulating cyber-physical attacks. The dam's operator reportedly immediately audited all dam control system access and passwords nationwide.

### Public Awareness Rising

The dam hack story was covered widely in Norwegian media in April, making cybersecurity a kitchen-table topic. The narrative shifted from "cyber attacks cause data loss" to "cyber attacks can cause real damage." A poll in late April found that 68% of Norwegians had heard about the dam cyberattack, and over 70% expressed worry about future attacks on critical services.

## Impact Assessment

- **1 major critical infrastructure attack** (Bremanger dam)
- **500 liters per second** of water released for 4 hours
- **68% of Norwegians** aware of the dam attack
- **70%+ expressed worry** about future attacks on critical services
- **NOK 200 million** (≈$20M) allocated to cyber defense in revised budget
- **Cybersecurity jumped** into top five security concerns for Norwegians

## Looking Ahead

April 2025 was characterized by a heightened threat environment for Norway. The Bremanger dam breach demonstrates that Norwegian critical infrastructure is being actively targeted by threat actors. Norway's emphasis on collective defense as a NATO member came into play, with NATO's cyber center briefed on the dam attack. The Nordic countries collaboratively raised their cyber alert levels in late April due to fears of further Russian reprisals.
