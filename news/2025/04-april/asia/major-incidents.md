### Late March Context – KLIA Ransomware (Malaysia)

- **Date:** March 31, 2025 (impact carried into April)
- **Target:** Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware
- **Impact:** Major service disruptions (flight info and operations affected)
- **Details:** In the last days of March, a ransomware attack hit KLIA's network, causing major service disruptions. While this occurred on March 31, it was a wake-up call carried into April, underscoring critical infrastructure risk in Southeast Asia.

  Regional experts in April pointed to the KLIA incident as a sign that Asian transport and energy infrastructure face rising cyber threats.

## Trends & Analysis

### Southeast Asia Surge

April was marked by an unprecedented surge in cyber attacks across Southeast Asia – a 56% increase in incident volume. Governments and companies in ASEAN countries reported a wave of both ransomware and DDoS attacks. Sectors like government services, education, and finance were heavily targeted.

**Breakdown of 217 incidents:**
- **~40%** malware/ransomware cases
- **~30%** DDoS or service outages
- **~30%** phishing-related breaches and fraud

For example:
- Thailand reported 50+ government website defacements in one week (attributed to hacktivists)
- Indonesia's BNPT (counterterrorism agency) faced a significant data leak of 26,000 records

### Critical Infrastructure at Risk

Critical infrastructure across Asia is on high alert. Power grids, transport hubs, and water systems are increasingly digitized and becoming attractive targets. For example, utility providers in India faced attempted intrusions in April (Indian officials quietly disclosed an attempted attack on load dispatch centers, thwarted by new security controls).

### Workforce and Preparedness

A recurring theme in Asia's cybersecurity landscape is the skills shortage. Southeast Asia faces a shortfall of tens of thousands of skilled cybersecurity workers. This gap means slower incident response and potentially higher breach costs.

In response, countries like Vietnam and Indonesia announced new investments in cybersecurity training programs in April. Companies increasingly turned to outsourced Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) for 24/7 monitoring.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### Singapore Regulatory Action

In the wake of the Toppan breach, Singapore's regulators took swift action. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Cyber Security Agency (CSA) announced they are working on updated guidelines for outsourced service providers.

MAS signaled it will mandate banks to include stronger contractual security requirements and notification timelines when vendors suffer breaches. The CSA launched an investigation into TNT and indicated it may name-and-shame vendors with inadequate cybersecurity.

### India – Data Protection & CERT-In

April was the first full month under India's new Digital Personal Data Protection Act (effective end of 2024). The Indian government used April to publicize enforcement of data breach penalties. India's CERT-In released updated incident reporting advisories, reminding companies of the 6-hour reporting rule for certain incidents.

Furthermore, India's power ministry directed all regional load dispatch centers to comply with strict cyber audit requirements by Q2, after an uptick in attempted intrusions.

### Japan – Critical Infrastructure Strategy

The Japanese government in April 2025 refined its Critical Infrastructure Protection strategy. It introduced sector-by-sector cybersecurity guidelines (for transportation, finance, healthcare) and set up a new national Cyber Incident Mobile Assistance Team (C-SIMAT) to help during major incidents.

This came as Japan prepares for large events (Osaka Expo 2025) and after learning from incidents like the February 2025 Toyota supplier ransomware attack.

### South Korea – Telecom Compensation Order

In late April (announced May 1), South Korea's Personal Information Protection Commission decided to order SK Telecom to compensate users for a January hack that leaked subscriber data. South Korea also discussed amending its Network Act to increase fines for data breaches.

### ASEAN Cooperation

ASEAN member states moved to deepen cooperation. In April, ASEAN officials met to lay groundwork for a "Cybersecurity Incident Response Network" among their CERTs. They agreed to share threat intelligence in near-real-time, especially on banking malware and critical infrastructure threats.

## Statistics

### Surge in Southeast Asia

- **217 reported incidents** in April (56% increase)
- **40%** were malware/ransomware cases
