# April 2025 - Asia Summary

## Overview

April 2025 witnessed an unprecedented surge in cyber attacks across Asia, with Southeast Asia experiencing a 56% increase in incident volume (217 incidents). The region saw a mix of supply-chain attacks, state-sponsored espionage, ransomware, and credential stuffing campaigns targeting financial services, critical infrastructure, and government sectors.

## Key Trends

### Southeast Asia Surge

Southeast Asia saw a dramatic 56% increase in cyber attacks, with 217 incidents reported. Government services, education, and finance were heavily targeted. The attempted ransomware attack on Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at March's end dominated early April security discussions, highlighting critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.

### Supply Chain and Third-Party Risk

The TNT breach in Singapore demonstrated how an attack on an IT vendor can affect multiple financial institutions simultaneously. DBS Bank reported ~8,200 client statements at risk, and Bank of China's Singapore branch reported ~3,000 customers affected. In India, a breach at a payment processor led to thousands of credit cards being sold online, forcing multiple banks to reissue cards.

### State Actors and APTs

North Korea's hacking units were particularly active. Lazarus launched the SyncHole campaign against South Korean organizations, while Kimsuky targeted South Korean think tanks and diplomats via spear-phishing. Chinese APTs persisted in stealth operations, with India's CERT accusing a China-linked group of infiltrating Indian power sector networks.

### Financial Sector Under Siege

Four large Australian pension funds (AustralianSuper, Hostplus, REST, Australian Retirement Trust) were hit by credential stuffing affecting over 20,000 retirement accounts. Some members saw unauthorized withdrawals from their superannuation savings. Jordan Kuwait Bank was listed by the Everest ransomware group with 11.7 GB of data claimed stolen.

## Impact Assessment

- **217 incidents** in Southeast Asia (56% increase)
- **20,000+ Australian retirement accounts** compromised via credential stuffing
- **11,200+ bank customers** affected by TNT Singapore breach
- **10,000 students** personal data accessed at Western Sydney University
- **State-sponsored campaigns** intensified across the region

## Looking Ahead

The concentration of supply-chain attacks, the surge in Southeast Asia incidents, and aggressive state-sponsored espionage position Asia as a major cybersecurity hotspot. The region faces a critical skills shortage, with tens of thousands of needed cybersecurity workers unfilled. Countries are responding with new training programs and regulatory measures, but the threat landscape is evolving faster than defensive capabilities in many nations.
