## Major Incidents

### April 7 – Marks & Spencer (UK) – Retail Disruption

- **Date:** April 7, 2025
- **Target:** Marks & Spencer (British retail giant)
- **Attack Type:** Cyber incident (attributed to Scattered Spider hacking group)
- **Impact:** In-store payments, online orders, gift card processing, and click-and-collect services halted
- **Attribution:** Scattered Spider hacking group (expert attribution)

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### NIS2 Directive Implementation

EU Member States advanced in implementing the new NIS2 cybersecurity directive. Cyprus adopted its NIS2 national law on April 25, 2025, expanding the scope of regulated "essential" and "important" entities and imposing stricter security and incident reporting obligations.

**Key Requirements:**
- State-of-the-art risk management (MFA, supply-chain security, encryption)
- Significant incidents must be reported within 24 hours (initial) and 72 hours (full)
- Enhanced security provisions for encryption practices and incident response frameworks

### EU Cyber Solidarity Act

The EU began operationalizing the Cyber Solidarity Act (entered into force February 2025) to improve collective preparedness, threat detection, and incident response across the Union. In April, EU institutions worked on establishing a proposed Cyber Reserve of incident responders and a cross-border SOC network. These efforts aim to help member states (especially smaller ones) handle large-scale cyber incidents through mutual assistance.

### Cyber Resilience Act Progress

On April 3, European standards bodies CEN/CENELEC accepted a standardization request for the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). This step is part of implementing the CRA, which was adopted in late 2024 and is slated to apply from 2027. It signals progress in defining technical standards (e.g., for software security, vulnerability disclosure, and SBOM requirements) that manufacturers must follow.

### UK Cyber Security & Resilience Bill

The United Kingdom announced a forthcoming Cyber Security & Resilience Bill that aligns with many EU principles. The policy statement emphasized resilience, incident reporting, and public-private cooperation, echoing EU's NIS2. The UK also mapped its new corporate cyber governance code to the NIST framework in April, underscoring board-level accountability for cyber risk.

### APT Targeting

At least 22 embassy and diplomatic staff inboxes were compromised via APT29 phishing waves. Intelligence agencies in France, Germany, and the Netherlands publicly linked various cyber incidents to Russian state-backed actors in Q1-Q2 2025, suggesting dozens of covert operations were active during April.
