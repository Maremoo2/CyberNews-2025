# April 2025 - European Union Summary

## Overview

Europe in April saw a mix of financially motivated attacks and geopolitically driven threats. Ransomware and data-extortion continued to plague European businesses and public services, with attacks on critical infrastructure coming to the forefront. The Spanish water utility attack and concerns about disrupting water supply demonstrated that essential services are under active threat. EU officials warned that Russia-linked groups are aggressively "poking and prodding" vital systems like water and energy as part of a hybrid warfare strategy.

## Key Trends

### Critical Infrastructure Under Attack

April's events highlighted critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. The Spanish water utility attack (Aigües de Mataró) and the Norwegian dam sabotage illustrated that water and energy systems face serious cyber risks. Denmark revealed that Russian hackers caused a 2024 water facility outage by altering pressure, bursting pipes. These incidents demonstrate a shift from nuisance-level DDoS attacks to more impactful sabotage attempts, with the goal of sowing fear and chaos.

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

European firms continued to suffer from supply-chain attacks. The Royal Mail/Spectos breach showed how a compromise at a German third-party analytics provider exposed UK customer data. Similarly, Ahold Delhaize confirmed that a November 2024 hack of its U.S. unit led to data theft. Corporate IT outages like the M&S incident demonstrated that cyber attacks can swiftly move from digital to real-world business disruption.

### State-Sponsored Espionage

Europe remained in the crosshairs of nation-state hackers. North Korea's Lazarus Group targeted at least three European defense firms (including UAV/drone component manufacturers) via fake job recruitment lures in Operation DreamJob. European governments faced continued phishing and intrusion attempts by Russian APTs (e.g., APT29 using fake "wine-tasting" invites to compromise diplomats' emails). Germany and France publicly accused Russian actors of election interference and ministry hacks in late April/early May.

### Regulatory Progress

EU Member States advanced in implementing the NIS2 cybersecurity directive. Cyprus adopted its NIS2 national law on April 25, 2025, expanding the scope of regulated entities and imposing stricter security and incident reporting obligations. The EU began operationalizing the Cyber Solidarity Act to improve collective preparedness and incident response. The draft Cyber Resilience Act saw progress with standardization requests accepted on April 3.

## Impact Assessment

- **Multiple critical infrastructure attacks** targeting water utilities and energy systems
- **144 GB of data leaked** in Royal Mail/Spectos breach
- **130,000 customers** potentially affected in Spanish water utility breach
- **22 embassy and diplomatic staff inboxes** compromised via APT29 phishing
- **19-22 ransomware incidents** each in UK, Germany, and Italy
- **Defense supply chain** targeted by North Korean espionage

## Looking Ahead

The dual battle continues – cybercriminal ransomware hitting healthcare, retail, and local utilities for profit, and state-sponsored operations targeting government, infrastructure, and high-tech sectors for strategic advantage. The EU's regulatory initiatives (NIS2, Cyber Solidarity Act, Cyber Resilience Act) demonstrate commitment to strengthening collective defense, but the persistent targeting of critical infrastructure and the success of supply-chain attacks underscore ongoing challenges in maintaining robust cybersecurity across member states.
