# April 2025 - United States Summary

## Overview

April's cyber events reinforced several trends in the United States. Ransomware remained the dominant threat, with criminals expanding their focus beyond traditional targets. The healthcare sector was hit especially hard: multiple hospital systems, insurers, and clinics announced breaches or attacks, making it clear that patient data and healthcare continuity are at risk.

The month saw approximately 224 ransomware attacks targeting U.S.-based organizations, accounting for nearly half of all reported attacks worldwide. By the end of April, over 130 publicly reported data breaches affected roughly 12 million individuals, with healthcare contributing ~60% of those affected.

## Key Trends

### Healthcare Under Siege

The healthcare sector suffered devastating attacks. Yale New Haven Health (5.5 million patients) and Blue Shield of California (4.7 million members) led the massive data exposures. DaVita Healthcare, despite being hit by Interlock ransomware, demonstrated effective incident response by maintaining patient care through backup processes. Healthcare providers are now treating cybersecurity as a life safety issue, given ransomware's potential to cripple clinical systems.

### Government and Financial Sector Breaches

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) email breach was a stark reminder of supply chain and espionage threats. Unidentified hackers quietly exfiltrated over 150,000 sensitive emails from ~100 senior officials for months, potentially foreign state actors targeting financial regulatory data. Baltimore Schools revealed that a February ransomware attack stole data on thousands of students, teachers, and staff.

### Supply Chain and Third-Party Vulnerabilities

Attackers exploited third-party software vulnerabilities and cloud misconfigurations. The Hertz breach via a file transfer zero-day and Blue Shield's vendor incident highlight that organizations are only as secure as their ecosystem. Young Consulting's breach exposed 2.6 million individuals' data, emphasizing the need for software supply-chain security and vendor diligence.

### Ransomware Evolution

Financially motivated groups are using more sophisticated tactics like multi-layered extortion. The Cactus ransomware attack on media firm Urban One combined data theft with social engineering. At least 11 ransomware variants were active in the U.S., with Qilin, BlackCat, LockBit, and Akira among the most prevalent.

## Impact Assessment

- **224 ransomware attacks** in the U.S. (nearly 50% of global total)
- **12 million individuals** affected by data breaches
- **$5.5M+ patients** exposed in Yale New Haven Health breach
- **150,000+ sensitive emails** compromised at OCC
- **Manufacturing sector** hit hard with Sensata production shutdowns
- **Ransom demands** ranging from $200k to $5M+

## Looking Ahead

The concentration of ransomware attacks on healthcare and the success of email-based compromises underscore that attackers are exploiting basic security gaps rather than sophisticated zero-day vulnerabilities. The OCC breach and DaVita incident demonstrate that both prevention and resilience are critical. Organizations are increasingly treating cybersecurity as a board-level risk, aligning with the national cybersecurity strategy push for corporate accountability.
