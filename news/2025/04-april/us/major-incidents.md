## Major Data Breaches

### April 14 – DaVita Healthcare – Ransomware

- **Date:** April 14, 2025
- **Target:** DaVita (one of the largest U.S. dialysis providers)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware
- **Attribution:** Interlock ransomware gang
- **Impact:** Portions of IT network encrypted; ~1.5 TB of data claimed stolen; some operations impaired
- **Details:** Dialysis provider DaVita was struck by Interlock ransomware. The attackers encrypted portions of DaVita's IT network and claimed to have stolen approximately 1.5 TB of data. 

  Despite the disruption, DaVita kept clinics running and patient care continued via backup processes.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### Federal Incident Reporting Rules

April saw continued work on implementing the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) of 2022. While the final rule is still in draft, CISA used April's incidents to gather input on defining reportable incidents and timelines. Regulators (like HHS in healthcare) reminded organizations of forthcoming 72-hour incident reporting requirements for critical sectors.

### NIST Incident Response Guidance

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published its updated Incident Response guidance (SP 800-61 Rev. 3) on April 3, 2025. This revision overhauls the 4-phase IR lifecycle into alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

**Key Updates:**
- New emphasis on threat intelligence integration
- Cloud incident handling procedures
- Continuous learning from incidents
- Alignment with NIST CSF 2.0

Federal agencies and many private companies will be adopting these recommendations. CISA and the FBI promoted the new guidance in April.

### Data Security & Privacy

In response to breaches like OCC and Blue Shield, federal officials in April renewed calls for a national data security law. The Administration highlighted the need for baseline privacy protections and vendor security requirements. While Congress did not pass new legislation in April, the topic gained bipartisan attention. The FTC signaled it would use existing authority to penalize companies that fail to secure consumer data.

### Sector-Specific Initiatives

**Department of Energy:** Launched a program to harden electric grid software amid rising infrastructure attacks.

**TSA:** Updated pipeline and rail cybersecurity directives (announced in March) took effect in April, requiring operators to implement network segmentation and continuous monitoring.

**State Laws:**
- **Florida:** Passed a law mandating cyber incident reporting by state agencies and requiring annual risk assessments
- **Maryland:** Introduced a bill to fund school system cybersecurity upgrades
- Several states' new data breach notification law updates came into effect

## Statistics

### Ransomware Incidents

The U.S. saw approximately 224 known ransomware attacks in April, accounting for nearly half of all reported attacks worldwide. Breakdown by sector:
- **~20%** hit manufacturing/industry
- **~15%** targeted healthcare
- Others struck education, finance, tech, and government

At least 11 ransomware variants were active: Qilin, BlackCat, LockBit, and Akira among the most prevalent.

### Data Breach Tally

By the end of April, the Identity Theft Resource Center recorded over 130 publicly reported data breaches in the U.S. for the month, affecting roughly 12 million individuals (a jump from March, due largely to mega-breaches in healthcare).

**Breakdown:**
- **Healthcare:** ~60% of those affected (5.5M YNHHS + 4.7M Blue Shield)
- **Finance:** Landmark Admin & Young Consulting (2.6M combined)
- **Government:** Long Beach 470k, OCC 150k sensitive records

### Cost Estimates

Ransomware demands observed in the U.S. during April ranged from $200,000 to millions of dollars. For instance:
- Negotiations with Akira gang suggested mid-sized firms were asked for $300k-$1M ransoms
- Large corporate victims likely faced demands upwards of $5M
- By April 2025, Akira had extorted $42 million from victims since its emergence

### Phishing & Email Compromise

Business email compromise (BEC) and phishing continued at high levels. One security firm reported that in April the average organization faced 1.6 email-based attacks that bypassed filtering per week.

The OCC breach demonstrated the potential scale: 100+ mailboxes accessed. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) showed BEC losses in the U.S. remained around $50M+ per month.

### Federal Security Posture

According to OMB's Federal Cybersecurity metrics, as of April 2025 about 75% of civilian agencies met the target for implementing log retention and EDR on endpoints (an improvement from ~65% in 2024). However, April's incidents (like OCC) suggest gaps remain in monitoring and zero trust protections.
