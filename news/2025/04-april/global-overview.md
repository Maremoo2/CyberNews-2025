# Cybersecurity Incidents – April 2025

## Global Overview

### Trends & Analysis

April 2025 demonstrated growing boldness among threat actors in targeting both digital and physical systems. Global ransomware activity saw a slight decline in volume for April (about 470 victims, down 29% from March), yet attacks grew in sophistication. New ransomware groups (e.g., Silent, Crypto24, Bert, Gunra) emerged alongside dominant crews like Qilin. The manufacturing sector was hit hardest (72 ransomware incidents globally), reflecting criminals' focus on disrupting supply chains.

Large-scale data breaches continued to compromise millions of individuals' data across healthcare, finance, and retail sectors. A single breach at a U.S. hospital system (Yale New Haven Health) exposed 5.5 million records. Attackers increasingly leveraged supply chain vulnerabilities – multiple third-party compromises cascaded into client data loss (Royal Mail incident stemmed from a breach at its German analytics provider Spectos, and Hertz's breach was traced to a compromised file transfer appliance).

Another notable pattern was the creative use of trusted platforms for phishing: the "PoisonSeed" campaign showed how infiltrating widely-used email services (Mailchimp, SendGrid, HubSpot, Mailgun, Zoho) can dramatically amplify malicious reach. Security researchers also warned of more AI-generated phishing lures, with roughly 12% of phishing emails now AI-crafted to mimic writing styles and evade detection.

Crucially, April underscored the cyber-physical convergence of threats – a cyber sabotage of a Norwegian dam demonstrated how attacks can spill into the physical world, prompting global discussions on protecting critical infrastructure. Organizations with robust incident response plans and resilient architectures fared best, reinforcing the shift toward an "assume breach" mentality focused not just on prevention but on rapid containment and recovery.

## Major Global Incidents

### April 4 – PoisonSeed Phishing Campaign

- **Attack Type:** Supply-chain phishing via trusted email platforms
- **Impact:** Worldwide victims tricked into giving up cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases
- **Attribution:** Unknown
- **Details:** Attackers hijacked trusted email marketing platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid, HubSpot, Mailgun, Zoho) to blast out fake cryptocurrency wallet "seed phrase" emails. This supply-chain phishing attack bypassed filters by abusing legitimate services, tricking victims worldwide into giving up crypto keys.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### NIST Guidance (USA/Global)

In early April, NIST released Special Publication 800-61 Rev. 3 updating its Incident Response guidelines. The revised framework aligns with modern threats and the NIST CSF 2.0, emphasizing continuous response improvement and integration of threat intelligence. This update has global influence, as organizations worldwide adopt NIST best practices to strengthen cyber resilience.

### International Cooperation

Governments continued joint efforts against ransomware and state-sponsored threats. The International Counter Ransomware Task Force (consortium of 36 nations) intensified information exchanges in response to the month's ransomware trends, providing multinational investigation support in cases like the Cl0p campaign.

### Resilience Emphasis

Policymakers globally highlighted the need for cyber resilience. The U.K. outlined plans for a new Cyber Security and Resilience Bill to bolster critical infrastructure defenses and incident response, aligning with international standards such as the EU NIS2 directive. Other countries signaled moves to update cyber laws focusing on mandatory reporting and business continuity.
