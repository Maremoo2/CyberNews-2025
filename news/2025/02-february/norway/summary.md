# February 2025 - Norway Cybersecurity News

## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Intelligence Warnings

In February, Norwegian intelligence agencies issued stark warnings about escalating cyber threats. The Police Security Service (PST), in its annual threat assessment released this month, cautioned that **Russia is likely to continue cyber and subversive activities targeting Norway's critical infrastructure**.

This warning came on the heels of observed Russian-linked operations against Norwegian energy facilities in the past year. PST emphasized that hostile cyber operations – including potential sabotage of power grids, telecom networks, or other essential services – pose a growing risk amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

### National Cyber Strategy Implementation

The Norwegian government has been actively rolling out measures from its new cyber strategy (detailed in White Paper Meld. St. 9 (2024–2025)). In February, officials reiterated plans to establish a **"Cyber Security Reserve"** – a pool of cybersecurity experts from government and industry that can be mobilized in major crises. This reserve is envisioned to provide surge capacity during incidents that exceed ordinary staffing, enhancing Norway's ability to respond to large-scale attacks.

The government is also developing a **National Cyber Security Portal** (scheduled to launch in 2025) to centralize threat information and best practices for businesses and citizens. Additionally, February saw Norway deepen cooperation with Nordic and EU partners – for instance, Norway confirmed participation in the EU's Cyber Solidarity Act efforts and a Nordic-Baltic cyber defense collaboration headquartered in Copenhagen.

### Legislation and Compliance

Norway is in the process of updating its laws to match EU cybersecurity directives. By Feb 2025, the government was finalizing adaptation of the **NIS2 Directive** into national law (building on the draft Digital Security Act). While NIS2 wasn't yet in force in Norway, regulators used February to urge companies to start aligning with the incoming requirements – such as:

- Stricter incident reporting within 24 hours
- Executive accountability for cyber risks
- Enhanced supply chain security measures

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority and NSM also conducted outreach in early 2025 about new EU rules like the **Cyber Resilience Act** (which Norway will mirror for IoT device security). Essentially, February saw a continuation of Norway's efforts to harmonize with EU cyber regulations and to bolster its legal framework for protecting critical networks.

## Trends & Analysis

Norway's cyber threat landscape in February 2025 was characterized by high alert levels and proactive defense planning. Threat analysis from Norwegian authorities pointed to Russia as the top adversary, primarily due to the geopolitical fallout of Norway's support for Ukraine.

PST assessed that pro-Russian hackers are increasingly willing to conduct disruptive attacks on Norwegian soil to "send a message," and noted a change in their behavior – moving from espionage toward more destructive tactics aimed at sowing fear. This assessment proved prescient given the dam sabotage incident that would later be attributed to Russian actors.

Meanwhile, Norwegian critical sectors (energy, maritime, defense) continued to be probed by advanced threat groups. For instance, unpublicized reports indicated frequent scanning and phishing attempts against Norway's oil & gas companies, likely by state-sponsored groups seeking access to Europe's largest gas supplier.

In the absence of major incidents, Norway focused on shoring up its cyber resilience: the narrative in February was about preparation and investment. Officials highlighted that cyberattacks are **"constantly increasing in both number and complexity,"** requiring Norway to strengthen its capabilities on par with allies.

The government's multi-faceted plan – from creating a cyber reserve to boosting R&D and establishing a national cloud for critical infrastructure – reflects an understanding that Norway must tackle both immediate threats and systemic weaknesses (like talent shortages and reliance on foreign tech).

### Private Sector Trends

In terms of private sector trends, Norwegian companies have shown growing cybersecurity awareness. There's anecdotal evidence that more firms are investing in cyber insurance and advanced threat detection, spurred by incidents in prior years (e.g., the 2019 Norsk Hydro ransomware attack remains a cautionary tale).

In summary, Norway spent February 2025 on heightened vigilance, heeding intelligence warnings and accelerating plans to improve national cyber defense, even as the month passed without a publicly disclosed crisis.

## Statistics

### Breach Prevalence
Nearly **30% of Norwegian organizations surveyed** have experienced a data breach in recent years. This figure, reported in a late-2024 study of Norwegian SMBs, underlines that a significant portion of businesses – not just large enterprises – have been victims of cyber incidents. It reinforces the government's push for better security across all sectors, as even smaller companies (which form critical supply chain links) are frequently targeted.

### Critical Infrastructure Incidents
According to NSM, in 2024 Norway had **50+ significant cyber incidents** affecting critical infrastructure (energy, transport, government) – a number that was trending upward into 2025. By February 2025, minor cyber events (like DDoS attacks on public services or malware infections on municipal IT systems) were occurring almost weekly, though most caused only brief outages.

The lack of a major incident in February may be partly luck and partly improved defenses thwarting attempted attacks.

### Incident Response Readiness
Norway's Cybersecurity Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) report that in early 2025, the **median response time to a reported cyber incident was about 6 hours** from detection to initial containment. This is an improvement from ~8 hours in 2023, attributed to better monitoring and drill practice. The government's goal (as stated in its strategy) is to get this down to 4 hours by 2026 for critical incidents.

### Cyber Workforce & Investment
As of Feb 2025, Norway faced an estimated **shortfall of 4,000 cybersecurity professionals**, reflecting the global skills gap. To address this, the government in February announced a scholarship program for cybersecurity degrees and continued to earmark funds for cyber research – including extending funding for industrial PhD positions in cyber defense and cryptology.

On the spending side, Norwegian organizations (public and private) were expected to increase cybersecurity spending by **12% in 2025, reaching roughly NOK 11 billion (about USD 1.1 billion)**. This includes major investments by oil & gas companies in OT security after warnings about pipeline vulnerabilities.
