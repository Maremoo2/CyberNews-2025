# February 2025 - Norway Major Incidents

## National Cyber Incidents

No major new cyber incidents specific to Norway were publicly reported in February 2025. Unlike some neighboring countries, Norway did not disclose any significant government or critical infrastructure breaches during this month.

However, Norwegian authorities warned that the absence of headline-grabbing attacks does not imply a low threat level. Ongoing covert cyber activities – particularly espionage and reconnaissance – are believed to be targeting Norway continuously.

### Threat Context
Norway's National Security Authority (NSM) and security service PST remained on high alert for potential attacks on critical infrastructure, including threats to dam controls, power grids, and telecom networks. The absence of major incidents in February likely reflects both improved defensive measures and ongoing vigilance, though security experts emphasized that Norway's critical infrastructure remains a prime target for hostile actors.

## Norwegian Company Breaches

Similarly, no high-profile Norwegian company breaches were disclosed in Feb 2025. Norwegian businesses largely avoided the kind of massive data breaches seen elsewhere this month.

That said, cybersecurity experts believe several Norwegian firms were likely hit by smaller-scale ransomware or phishing incidents that went unreported publicly. Norway's financial and energy sectors are under constant assault (often by state-sponsored actors probing for weaknesses), and minor incidents often get handled quietly.

It's also worth noting that some breaches affecting Norway may have been reported through international subsidiaries or vendors – for example, if a global service provider with Norwegian clients suffered a breach, the impact on Norwegian data might only emerge in broader reports.

Overall, February was a relatively quiet month for publicly known corporate breaches in Norway, but companies remained vigilant.
