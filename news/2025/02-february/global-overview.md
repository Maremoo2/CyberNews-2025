# Cybersecurity Incidents – February 2025

## Global Overview

### Trends & Analysis

February 2025 was marked by record-breaking cyberattacks and evolving threat tactics worldwide. Ransomware activity surged to an all-time high this month, with a 50% jump in cases compared to January. Major state-sponsored operations also intensified – for example, CrowdStrike reported a 150% spike in Chinese cyber-espionage activity in 2024 targeting sectors like finance, media, manufacturing, and telecom. At the same time, financially motivated attacks escalated: North Korea's Lazarus Group pulled off the largest cryptocurrency theft in history (over $1.5 billion), underscoring the global reach and impact of cybercrime.

Security experts note a continued blurring of lines between nation-state and criminal actors, with tools from espionage campaigns being repurposed for profit-driven attacks. Overall, the month's incidents highlight that no region or industry was spared, reinforcing the need for robust international cyber defense coordination.

## Major Incidents

### Feb 21 – Bybit (Cryptocurrency Exchange)
- **Attack Type:** Crypto wallet breach
- **Impact:** $1.46 billion in Ethereum stolen from an exchange cold wallet
- **Attribution:** Allegedly Lazarus Group (North Korea)
- **Details:** The theft is believed to be the largest crypto hack on record, with investigators linking it to the notorious state-backed Lazarus hacking unit.

### Feb 13 – Zacks Investment Research
- **Attack Type:** Data breach (account data leak)
- **Impact:** 12 million client accounts' data (names, emails, addresses, phone numbers) exposed for sale on a hacker forum
- **Attribution:** A BreachForums user ("Jurak") claimed responsibility
- **Details:** The breach actually occurred in mid-2024 but was revealed in late January when samples of the data were posted online.

### Feb 13 – Global Cisco Router Exploitation
- **Attack Type:** Network intrusions (supply chain)
- **Impact:** Chinese APT "Salt Typhoon" compromised >1,000 Cisco routers globally (over half in the U.S. and others in South America, India, etc.) by exploiting an unpatched Cisco IOS XE flaw
- **Details:** The campaign, which spanned Dec 2024–Jan 2025, enabled persistent access into telecom networks and other targets worldwide.

### Feb 10 – Lee Enterprises (U.S.)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware (Qilin group)
- **Impact:** Systems of one of the largest newspaper chains were encrypted, halting publishing operations for dozens of newspapers and disrupting business processes (distribution, billing, etc.)
- **Attribution:** The Qilin ransomware gang claimed the attack on Feb 27, releasing proof of 350 GB of stolen data and threatening to leak sensitive corporate and investor information.

## Statistics

- **886 ransomware attacks** were recorded globally in February 2025 – a ~50% increase from the prior month (590 in Jan) and up 119% from Feb 2024. This is the highest monthly total ever observed, driven in part by mass exploitation of file-transfer software vulnerabilities by groups like Cl0p.

- **North America and Europe** accounted for 83% of these ransomware cases (with North America alone hit by ~65% of attacks). Asia saw about 7% of attacks, and other regions the remainder.

- **Over 15 million personal records** were reported compromised in major data breaches disclosed in February. Notable examples include ~12 million user records at Zacks and 3.3 million individuals' data at DISA (a U.S. screening firm), among others.

- **$1.5 billion+ in cryptocurrency** was stolen in a single incident (Bybit hack), contributing to an estimated several billion dollars in cybercrime losses for the month.

- **Law enforcement globally** responded with enhanced crackdowns – for instance, an international operation dismantled the 8Base ransomware gang's infrastructure and led to multiple arrests in February.
