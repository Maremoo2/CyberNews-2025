# February 2025 - European Union Cybersecurity News

## Trends & Analysis

State-sponsored threats and big-game ransomware remained acute across the EU in February. European security agencies reported that Russia-linked groups (e.g. Sandworm APT) continued targeting critical infrastructure in Europe, likely in retaliation for European support to Ukraine. Meanwhile, China-nexus cyber espionage expanded in the region – for instance, Chinese hackers were revealed to have compromised the Belgian intelligence service's email systems (via a previously disclosed Barracuda vulnerability) over 2021–2023.

On the cybercrime front, European healthcare and public sectors faced aggressive ransomware campaigns. One notable operation dubbed "Green Nailao" hit multiple European healthcare organizations in late 2024, deploying new malware (NailaoLocker) via a Chinese-linked toolkit. Law enforcement collaboration in Europe also yielded successes – Europol and national police shut down the 8Base ransomware gang's leak site and arrested suspects in early February (in a joint operation in Thailand).

Additionally, EU authorities are increasingly focusing on insider risks and deepfake fraud: in Italy, an AI-generated voice scam impersonating a government minister tricked a businessman into a €1 million payment, highlighting emerging threats that EU institutions and companies must guard against.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### EU Cyber Solidarity Act
- **Date:** February 4, 2025
- **Details:** The Cyber Solidarity Act entered into force, aiming to improve the EU's preparedness, detection, and response to cybersecurity incidents. This law establishes an EU-wide cyber emergency fund and a network of security operations centers to assist Member States during major attacks.

### Cyber Crisis Blueprint Update
- **Date:** February 24, 2025
- **Details:** The European Commission proposed an updated EU Cybersecurity Crisis Management Blueprint to strengthen coordination during large-scale cyber incidents. The blueprint clarifies roles of EU entities throughout a cyber crisis lifecycle (preparedness, detection, response, recovery) and calls for closer civilian-military and cross-border collaboration.

### National Initiatives

**Sweden's Backdoor Access Proposal:**
- **Date:** February 24, 2025
- **Details:** Sweden proposed a law to require backdoor access in encrypted messaging apps for law enforcement (targeting services like WhatsApp/Signal)

**UK Ransomware Legislation Consultation:**
- **Date:** February 19, 2025
- **Details:** The UK government launched a consultation regarding potential ransomware legislation to ban ransom payments and mandate incident reporting

## Statistics

- **Share of global attacks:** Roughly 18% of all ransomware attacks in Feb 2025 occurred in Europe (approx. 159 out of 886 cases), making Europe the second-most targeted region after North America. This reflects a significant rise in European cases year-on-year and underscores that EU organizations remain prime targets, especially for data-theft-centric extortion.

- **Healthcare under siege:** European organizations accounted for a large portion of the 278 ransomware attacks on the "Consumer Discretionary" sector globally (which includes healthcare) in February. Hospitals and medical research facilities in countries like France, Germany, and the UK continued to suffer disruptions, prompting calls for stronger healthcare cyber defenses (e.g. the NailaoLocker campaign targeted EU health entities).

- **Mass data leaks:** The 3.5 terabytes exfiltrated in the Bulgarian court breach is one of the largest data thefts ever recorded in a European government attack. Separately, millions of European citizens' data were impacted by breaches disclosed in February – including 1.3 million records in a leak affecting French telecom giant Orange (though much of that data was legacy), and hundreds of thousands of records in various UK breaches.

- **Regulatory moves:** As of Feb 2025, all EU member states were expected to have transposed the NIS2 Directive (deadline was Oct 2024). Many are now shifting to implementation and enforcement, which will bring expanded breach reporting and security requirements to thousands of EU companies. Additionally, February saw new EU funds allocated for cybersecurity – under the Cyber Solidarity Act's provisions – expected to total €1.1 billion through 2027 (to fund cross-border SOCs and rapid response teams).

## Chinese and Russian Cyber-Espionage in Europe

### Belgian Intelligence Service Breach
- **Date:** Revealed February 26, 2025
- **Details:** Chinese threat actors compromised the Belgian Secret Service (VSSE) e-mail exchanges between 2021 and 2023. The threat actors exploited a vulnerability in the e-mail system of a US software supplier, Barracuda, that was previously reported in 2023 and was being used by Belgian intelligence as well as the Belgian Pipeline Organisation.

### Green Nailao Healthcare Campaign
- **Date:** Reported February 18, 2025
- **Details:** A ransomware campaign, "Green Nailao," targeted European organizations, notably healthcare, between June and October 2024. The attack exploited CVE-2024-24919 to deploy ShadowPad and PlugX backdoors, later delivering the previously undocumented NailaoLocker ransomware. Researchers assess with medium confidence that the activity aligns with Chinese threat actors.

### AI-Driven Fraud in Italy
- **Date:** Reported February 9, 2025
- **Details:** Italian tycoons were targeted in an AI-driven scam where fraudsters used a deepfake voice of Defence Minister Guido Crosetto to request ransom payments for kidnapped journalists. At least one business leader transferred €1 million. The case echoes past high-profile scams and highlights the emerging threat of AI-generated voice fraud.
