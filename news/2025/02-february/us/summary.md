# February 2025 - United States Cybersecurity News

## Trends & Analysis

In the United States, February 2025 saw cyber threats intensify across both public and private sectors. Ransomware remained the number-one menace, with North America as a whole bearing 65% of the world's ransomware attacks this month. High-profile breaches impacting millions of Americans' data (e.g. Zacks, DISA, Grubhub) kept pressure on legislators to advance federal data protection and incident reporting laws.

Meanwhile, critical infrastructure and government entities experienced disruptive attacks – from court systems being shuttered to a Native American tribal government's services going dark. These incidents underscored gaps in cyber resilience at the state and local level, even as federal agencies bolstered their capabilities.

On the national security front, geopolitical cyber tensions remained in flux. U.S. intelligence continued to warn of Russian and Chinese cyber-espionage targeting U.S. networks, but policy shifts (like pausing offensive cyber ops against Russia) hinted at diplomatic recalibrations. The creation of unconventional government units like "DOGE" raised debate over insider risk and proper vetting, reflecting a broader concern: as government and industry rush to innovate (or cut costs), cybersecurity due diligence must not be overlooked.

On a positive note, law enforcement and international cooperation scored victories against cybercriminals this month – besides the 8Base gang takedown abroad, domestically the FBI and DOJ continued active investigations, and several ransomware actors were indicted under seal. The net U.S. outlook: a mix of escalating threats met with gradually improving defenses and an evolving policy landscape to address the growing cyber crisis.

## Statistics

### Ransomware Prevalence
North America (mostly U.S.) experienced roughly **574 ransomware attacks in February** (65% of the global 886) – a massive concentration. This was a sharp increase from ~380 attacks in Jan 2025 and more than double the volume in Feb 2024, reflecting how the U.S. remains cybercriminals' favorite target (due to the high value of American business data and greater likelihood of ransom payouts).

### Data Breaches Impact
The number of individuals affected by publicly disclosed breaches in the U.S. this month exceeded **15 million**. Notably, the DISA breach (3.3M) and Zacks breach (12M) alone sum to ~15.3 million people impacted. Other incidents (like healthcare provider and utility breaches reported to regulators in Feb) add thousands more.

The average cost of a data breach in the U.S. continues to be the highest in the world – around **$9.5 million per incident** as of 2024 – so these February cases could collectively cost hundreds of millions in mitigation, legal, and reputational damage.

### Federal Response and Spending
- U.S. federal cybersecurity spending for FY2025 was estimated at **$13.5 billion**, and additional funds were injected in February via initiatives like DHS grants to states
- The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) mid-year report (released Feb 2025) noted a **$90+ million loss** from reported crypto scams in the first two months of 2025, foreshadowing another costly year
- The report also highlighted a **30% increase in reported business email compromise (BEC)** incidents compared to early 2024, showing that "low-tech" fraud remains a significant threat alongside high-profile hacks

## Emerging Threats

### Ransomware Evolution
Ransomware groups have shifted toward data theft and extortion tactics, with attacks increasingly focusing on exfiltrating sensitive data before encryption. The Qilin gang's attack on Lee Enterprises exemplified this trend, with threats to leak 350 GB of data including financial records and confidential investor information.

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
The Grubhub breach through a third-party service provider underscored continuing supply chain risks. Organizations remain vulnerable through their vendors and partners, making third-party risk management a critical concern.

### Insider Risks and Vetting
The controversy over DOGE team access to federal systems highlighted concerns about proper vetting and insider threats, even from individuals intended to improve government efficiency.

### Critical Infrastructure Targeting
Local governments, tribal authorities, and municipal systems faced increasing attacks, revealing gaps in cybersecurity capabilities at the state and local level despite federal improvements.
