## Government Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Ransomware Sanctions
- **Date:** February 11, 2025
- **Details:** The U.S. Treasury Department – in coordination with the UK and Australia – sanctioned a Russia-based web hosting service (Z*Servers) that provided "bulletproof" infrastructure to the LockBit ransomware gang. By targeting this hosting provider, used to facilitate attacks, the U.S. aimed to disrupt LockBit's operations. This move followed earlier sanctions against LockBit affiliates, signaling a continued U.S. strategy of using financial levers against cybercriminal networks

### Federal Security Concerns
- **Date:** Reported February 7, 2025
- **Details:** An Atlantic report alleged that Elon Musk's fledgling "Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)" team had gained access to critical federal systems (e.g. Treasury and OPM networks) despite lacking cybersecurity training.

### Cyber Command Policy Shift
- **Date:** Reported February 28, 2025
- **Details:** The U.S. administration ordered Cyber Command to halt planning of any new offensive cyber ops against Russia.

The move drew some criticism from the cybersecurity community and some lawmakers

### Domestic Legislation
- **Details:** While no major federal cyber laws were passed in Feb, the debate around breach reporting and ransomware payments intensified. Lawmakers floated proposals to ban ransomware payments to disincentivize attackers and to mandate quicker breach notification to CISA for critical infrastructure. The White House continued rolling out its National Cyber Strategy Implementation Plan – expanding cybersecurity grants to state and local governments and working on an Executive Order for software bill of materials (SBOM) requirements for federal vendors
