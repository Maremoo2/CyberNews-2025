# February 2025 - Asia Cybersecurity News

## Regional Cyber Threats

Asia faced a diverse array of cyber threats in February 2025, driven by both state-sponsored groups and cybercriminal gangs. State actors in the region have been especially active: intelligence reports found that Chinese APT groups escalated operations by 150% in the past year, targeting not only regional rivals but also global interests.

In February, China-linked hackers continued wide-ranging cyber-espionage campaigns – for example, APT41 (a Chinese state-backed group) was discovered running a long-term spying effort ("RevivalStone") against Japanese industries. At the same time, North Korean threat actors carried out both espionage and huge financial heists; aside from spying on diplomats (e.g. Kimsuky's phishing of policy experts), North Korea's Lazarus Group stole an unprecedented $1.46 billion in a crypto hack.

Cybercriminal activity also grew across Asia, often overlapping with state tactics. Ransomware attacks hit major organizations in East and South Asia, and some used tools originally linked to Chinese espionage, blurring the lines between nation-state and criminal operations. Additionally, regional tensions spurred more attacks: activists and patriotic hacker groups on each side of conflicts (South Asia, Middle East) engaged in defacements and data leaks targeting their adversaries, though these were smaller in scale.

Overall, Asian nations are grappling with highly sophisticated adversaries – prompting governments from Japan to Australia to introduce new measures (laws, bans, and cyber commands) to bolster their cyber defenses.

## Emerging Trends

### Weaponization of Advanced Tech
A key emerging trend in Asia is the weaponization of advanced tech and crossover of tactics. Notably, threat actors in the region have begun embracing AI-powered attacks – e.g. using AI-generated personas and deepfakes in social engineering. In the past year, there was a **442% increase in AI-driven voice-phishing ("vishing") attacks globally**, much of it traced to Asian eCrime groups leveraging these tools.

This continued into Feb 2025 with instances of AI deepfakes used in financial scams in Asia (for example, scammers in Hong Kong reportedly used AI-cloned voices of company CEOs to authorize fraudulent fund transfers).

### Convergence of State and Criminal Cyber Operations
Another emerging trend is the convergence of state and criminal cyber operations: in February, Symantec revealed that tools traditionally used by Chinese espionage units (like PlugX malware) appeared in a ransomware attack on an Asian software company. This suggests either collaboration or leakage between state hackers and cybercriminals, complicating attribution and defense.

### Active Defense Policy Shifts
Finally, Asia is seeing a push toward "active defense" in cybersecurity – countries like Japan have passed bills to enable more aggressive cyber countermeasures (including hacking back at attackers' servers), a notable policy shift driven by the severity of threats. How these active defense strategies play out, and whether they deter attackers or escalate conflicts in cyberspace, will be a closely watched development.

## Trends & Analysis

Asia's cybersecurity landscape in Feb 2025 reflected high-stakes threats and robust responses. On one hand, nation-state threats in Asia are at an all-time high. Chinese cyber-espionage campaigns continue to expand in scope and sophistication, targeting Asian neighbors and global interests alike – the compromise of Japanese firms by APT41 and ongoing attacks on telecom networks across Asia illustrate this reach.

North Korea remains another linchpin of regional instability in cyberspace, as demonstrated by Lazarus Group's audacious cryptocurrency theft and Kimsuky's spying on NGOs.

On the other hand, Asian governments are responding with significant policy shifts. Japan's approval of a landmark Cyber Defense Bill in February, which authorizes preemptive threat hunting and server takedowns during attacks, signals a more proactive stance that may inspire similar moves by other nations in the region. Australia's ban of Kaspersky products from government systems (announced Feb 17) over espionage fears also shows rising caution against foreign technology risks.

Cybercrime in Asia is likewise evolving: ransomware and financial fraud are growing in volume, with local cyber gangs emerging alongside transnational groups. Notably, Southeast Asia saw an increase in ransomware hits on manufacturing and logistics companies (often under-reported), and South Asian financial institutions battled a wave of phishing and credential-stealing malware. This has galvanized public-private cooperation in some countries – e.g. India in February rolled out AI-based fraud analytics to flag suspicious banking transactions.

In summary, Asia's trend is a mix of intensifying threats and strengthening defenses, as nations in the region recognize cybersecurity as critical to national security and economic stability.

## Statistics

### Ransomware in Asia
Asia accounted for roughly **64 ransomware attacks in February** (about 7% of the global total) – a smaller share than other regions, yet this number is a significant **39% increase from the previous month** in Asia. The most targeted Asian countries for ransomware were China, Japan, India, and Australia, with industrial manufacturing and government services being top sectors.

### Mega-Breaches/Cyber-Heists
The **$1.46 billion theft from Bybit's crypto wallet** is not only Asia's largest cyber heist to date but also globally unprecedented. By comparison, the second-largest known crypto theft (Poly Network in 2021) was ~$610 million, meaning Lazarus Group's Feb 2025 haul more than doubled the prior record. This single incident dramatically skews the cybercrime losses associated with Asia for the month.

### State Actor Surge
Security reports show that **7 new China-linked APT groups were identified in 2024** (bringing the tracked total to over 40), illustrating the rapid expansion of China's cyber operations that continued into 2025. In terms of volume, Chinese state-sponsored intrusions averaged **1,200+ incidents per quarter globally in 2024**; a substantial portion of those targeted Asian organizations (Southeast Asian governments and South Asian telecoms were frequent targets).

### Government Countermeasures
By Feb 2025, at least **14 Asian-Pacific countries** have established dedicated cyber commands or agencies to bolster national cybersecurity (for instance, Japan's new Cyber Defense Unit, Singapore's Cyber Security Agency, India's National Critical Information Infrastructure Centre, etc.).

Additionally, more than half of APAC economies have introduced data protection or cyber incident reporting laws. Notably, Japan's Cybersecurity Strategy (updated 2025) set a goal to reduce government sector incidents by 30% year-on-year; metrics on whether this is being achieved are expected in late-2025 reports.

## Government Initiatives

### Japan's Cyber Defense Bill
- **Date:** Approved February 7, 2025
- **Details:** Japan's Cabinet approved the Cyber Response Capability Enhancement Bill to strengthen defences against sophisticated cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure. The bill includes active cyber defence measures, such as proactively detecting threats and shutting down enemy servers during an incident to mitigate potential harm

### Australia's Kaspersky Ban
- **Date:** Announced February 17, 2025
- **Details:** The Australian government banned all Kaspersky products from government systems, citing national security risks. The decision follows concerns over potential access by Russian intelligence services to sensitive data
