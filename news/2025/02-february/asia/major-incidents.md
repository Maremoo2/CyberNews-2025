## Major Incidents in China, Japan, Korea, India

### Feb 12 – Unimicron (Taiwan)
- **Date:** February 12, 2025
- **Target:** Unimicron (World's Leading PCB Manufacturer)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware (Sarcoma group)
- **Impact:** Data breach & operations disruption at the world's leading PCB (printed circuit board) manufacturer
- **Attribution:** Sarcoma ransomware gang
- **Details:** The relatively new Sarcoma group claimed it stole 377 GB of databases and documents from Unimicron's Taiwanese facilities. They posted samples of stolen files and threatened full data leakage if ransom demands were not met. This attack on a critical electronics supplier raised supply-chain security fears in the semiconductor industry

### Feb 18 – APT41 "RevivalStone" Campaign (Japan)
- **Date:** February 18, 2025
- **Target:** Multiple Japanese Firms (Manufacturing, Materials, Energy Sectors)
- **Attack Type:** Cyber-espionage
- **Impact:** Data theft and malware implants at multiple Japanese firms in manufacturing, materials, and energy sectors
- **Attribution:** China-linked APT41 (Winnti)
- **Details:** Japanese cybersecurity researchers revealed that APT41 had been infiltrating companies via a zero-day SQL injection in ERP software, deploying new malware and even using stolen code-signing certificates to remain undetected. The campaign, active since at least 2012, underscores China's long-term economic espionage targeting Japan's industries

### Feb 21 – CarMoney (Russia)
- **Date:** February 21, 2025
- **Target:** CarMoney (Russian Microfinance Company)
- **Attack Type:** Hack-and-leak (hacktivist)
- **Impact:** Customer loan data from a Russian microfinance company leaked online
- **Attribution:** Pro-Ukraine hacker collective "Cyber Alliance"
- **Details:** Cyber Alliance breached CarMoney, a lender reportedly linked to a business figure who is the ex-wife of President Putin, and claimed to obtain records on a large number of borrowers including Russian military and intelligence personnel. The hackers leaked portions of the data to expose individuals tied to the Ukraine conflict. Russian authorities neither confirmed nor denied the breach, but it exemplified the spillover of the Russia-Ukraine war into cyber space

### Feb 19 – Genea (Australia)
- **Date:** February 19, 2025
- **Target:** Genea (Australia's Largest IVF Clinic Network)
- **Attack Type:** Ransomware (Termite group)
- **Impact:** Healthcare services disrupted at Australia's largest IVF clinic network; patient data accessed
- **Attribution:** Termite ransomware gang
- **Details:** Genea, a fertility clinic operator, suffered a cyberattack that forced some patient services offline. The company confirmed hackers had accessed potentially sensitive health and personal information. Security researchers identified the Termite ransomware in this attack, a newer strain hitting the Asia-Pacific region. Australia's government treated the incident as part of a growing trend of attacks on healthcare and responded by accelerating plans for stricter healthcare data protection rules

### Indian and Southeast Asian Targets
- **Details:** No singular headline incident, but noteworthy trends include a surge in phishing and banking fraud in India and DDoS attacks in Southeast Asia. In India, the national CERT warned of a wave of spear-phishing campaigns against financial institutions and an uptick in digital payment fraud, though no mega-breach was reported in Feb. Separately, several Southeast Asian telecom companies continued to grapple with intrusions attributed to Chinese APTs (as part of the Salt Typhoon router exploits). While not a single incident, these regional developments indicate the persistent threat landscape Asian organizations face

## State-Sponsored Operations

### North Korean Cyber-Espionage (Kimsuky/Emerald Sleet)
- **Date:** Reported February 11, 2025
- **Target:** International affairs professionals and NGOs
- **Attack Type:** PowerShell exploits and social engineering
- **Details:** North Korea-linked Kimsuky (Emerald Sleet) is using a tactic where victims are deceived into running PowerShell as an administrator and executing malicious code. This facilitates data exfiltration via a remote desktop tool. The group primarily targets individuals working in international affairs, particularly those focused on Northeast Asia, in America, Europe, and East Asia

### China-Linked Salt Typhoon
