# January 2026 - United States Summary

## Overview

Early January 2026 saw significant ransomware activity in the United States, with notable prosecutions and corporate breaches. Two cybersecurity professionals faced justice for their roles in BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware attacks, while Sedgwick's federal contracting unit disclosed a data breach from a New Year's Eve TridentLocker attack. The healthcare sector continued to be a prime target, with Covenant Health notifying nearly half a million patients of a data breach from a 2025 cyberattack attributed to the Qilin ransomware group.

## Key Trends

### Insider Threat and Professional Misconduct

The guilty pleas of Ryan Goldberg and his co-defendant in the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware case highlight the growing concern of insider threats and compromised security professionals. Cybersecurity experts with privileged access and knowledge of security systems pose unique risks when they turn to cybercrime.

### Ransomware Targeting Critical Services

Both Sedgwick (a major claims administrator serving federal contractors) and Covenant Health (a large healthcare provider) were hit by sophisticated ransomware groups. These incidents demonstrate that ransomware operators continue to target organizations that provide essential services and hold sensitive data, maximizing leverage for extortion.

### Healthcare Sector Vulnerabilities

The healthcare sector remains under siege, with Covenant Health's breach affecting 478,188 individuals. The attribution to Qilin ransomware group shows that established ransomware-as-a-service operations continue to successfully penetrate healthcare networks, despite increased awareness and security measures.

Covenant Health reported that 7,800 individuals were affected by a data breach in July 2025, but updated the total to 478,188 in December 2025. The breach was later attributed to the Qilin ransomware group, with notifications being sent to affected patients in early January 2026.

### January 2, 2026 – ATM Jackpotting (Tren de Aragua Gang)

- **Date:** 2026-01-02
- **Target:** Hundreds of ATMs across the United States (primarily Nebraska and nationwide)
- **Attack Type:** Malware (Ploutus) / ATM Jackpotting

- **Source:** https://hstoday.us/

A federal grand jury indicted 54 members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, which has been designated as a terrorist organization. The gang allegedly deployed Ploutus malware to hack into hundreds of ATMs, forcing them to dispense cash in so-called "jackpotting" attacks. The stolen funds, totaling "many millions of dollars," were later laundered to fund terrorist activities. This represents a significant case connecting cybercrime, organized crime, and terrorism financing.

## Threat Actor Activity

### BlackCat/ALPHV

Two U.S. cybersecurity professionals (an incident response manager and digital forensics expert) were prosecuted for deploying BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware in attacks during 2023. They admitted to hacking dozens of companies across healthcare, technology, and pharmaceutical sectors, receiving approximately $1.2 million in Bitcoin ransom. Over 1,000 organizations were targeted in the broader BlackCat campaigns. This demonstrates that the group has been operating with insider assistance and highlights the significant risk of compromised security professionals with privileged knowledge.

### TridentLocker

The TridentLocker ransomware group claimed responsibility for the Sedgwick breach on New Year's Eve. The group exfiltrated 3.4GB of data before the breach was confirmed, following the typical double-extortion model.

### Qilin

The Qilin ransomware group was attributed to the Covenant Health breach that occurred in July 2025. The group's successful attack resulted in the exposure of nearly half a million patient records, making it one of the largest healthcare breaches of 2025.

### Tren de Aragua Gang

A Venezuelan criminal organization designated as a terrorist group, 54 members of Tren de Aragua were indicted for deploying Ploutus malware in ATM jackpotting attacks across the United States. The gang forced hundreds of ATMs to dispense cash, stealing "many millions of dollars" that were subsequently laundered to fund terrorist activities. This case represents a dangerous convergence of organized crime, cybercrime, and terrorism financing.

## Looking Ahead

### Key Takeaways

- Insider threats from compromised cybersecurity professionals pose a significant risk
- Healthcare remains the most targeted sector for ransomware attacks
- Ransomware groups continue to use double-extortion tactics (data theft + encryption)
- Federal contractors handling sensitive government data are prime targets
- Organized crime and terrorist groups are leveraging cybercrime for funding

## Conclusion

The first days of January 2026 demonstrated the expanding and evolving threat landscape facing U.S. organizations. Ransomware remains a critical threat, particularly in healthcare and government contracting sectors, with the Covenant Health breach affecting nearly half a million patients. The prosecution of two cybersecurity professionals for BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware attacks—resulting in over $9.5 million in losses across five companies—highlights the severe risks posed by insider threats and compromised security experts with privileged access.

The indictment of 54 Tren de Aragua gang members for ATM jackpotting attacks represents a troubling convergence of organized crime, cybercrime, and terrorism financing. The gang's use of Ploutus malware to steal millions of dollars from hundreds of ATMs demonstrates that criminal organizations are increasingly adopting sophisticated cyber capabilities. The connection to terrorism financing adds a national security dimension to cybercrime that requires enhanced coordination between cybersecurity, law enforcement, and counterterrorism agencies.

Law enforcement's success in prosecuting both the BlackCat insiders and the Tren de Aragua gang members shows that authorities are actively pursuing cybercriminals across the spectrum—from white-collar professionals to organized criminal enterprises. However, organizations must not rely solely on law enforcement. They must remain vigilant and invest in robust security measures, including insider threat programs, financial system protections, incident response capabilities, and accurate breach impact assessment processes. The dramatic increase in Covenant Health's breach count (from 7,800 to 478,188) underscores the importance of thorough and timely impact assessments.
