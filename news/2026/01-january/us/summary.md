# January 2026 - United States Summary

## Overview

Early January 2026 saw significant ransomware activity in the United States, with notable prosecutions and corporate breaches. Two cybersecurity professionals faced justice for their roles in BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware attacks, while Sedgwick's federal contracting unit disclosed a data breach from a New Year's Eve TridentLocker attack. The healthcare sector continued to be a prime target, with Covenant Health notifying nearly half a million patients of a data breach from a 2025 cyberattack attributed to the Qilin ransomware group.

## Key Trends

### Insider Threat and Professional Misconduct

The guilty pleas of Ryan Goldberg and his co-defendant in the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware case highlight the growing concern of insider threats and compromised security professionals. Cybersecurity experts with privileged access and knowledge of security systems pose unique risks when they turn to cybercrime.

### Ransomware Targeting Critical Services

Both Sedgwick (a major claims administrator serving federal contractors) and Covenant Health (a large healthcare provider) were hit by sophisticated ransomware groups. These incidents demonstrate that ransomware operators continue to target organizations that provide essential services and hold sensitive data, maximizing leverage for extortion.

### Healthcare Sector Vulnerabilities

The healthcare sector remains under siege, with Covenant Health's breach affecting 478,188 individuals. The attribution to Qilin ransomware group shows that established ransomware-as-a-service operations continue to successfully penetrate healthcare networks, despite increased awareness and security measures.

## Threat Actor Activity

### BlackCat/ALPHV

Two U.S. cybersecurity professionals were prosecuted for deploying BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware in multiple attacks during 2023. This demonstrates that the group has been operating with insider assistance and highlights the risk of compromised security professionals.

### TridentLocker

The TridentLocker ransomware group claimed responsibility for the Sedgwick breach on New Year's Eve. The group exfiltrated 3.4GB of data before the breach was confirmed, following the typical double-extortion model.

### Qilin

The Qilin ransomware group was attributed to the Covenant Health breach that occurred in July 2025. The group's successful attack resulted in the exposure of nearly half a million patient records, making it one of the largest healthcare breaches of 2025.

## Looking Ahead

### Key Takeaways

- Insider threats from compromised cybersecurity professionals pose a significant risk
- Healthcare remains the most targeted sector for ransomware attacks
- Ransomware groups continue to use double-extortion tactics (data theft + encryption)
- Federal contractors handling sensitive government data are prime targets
- Organizations must improve breach detection and response times
- Accurate impact assessment is critical (Covenant Health's count grew from 7,800 to 478,188)

### Priorities for Q1 2026

- Strengthen insider threat detection and monitoring programs
- Enhance healthcare sector cybersecurity defenses
- Improve vendor and third-party risk management
- Accelerate breach notification and impact assessment processes
- Increase collaboration between law enforcement and private sector

## Conclusion

The first days of January 2026 reinforced that ransomware remains a critical threat to U.S. organizations, particularly in healthcare and government contracting sectors. The prosecution of insider threats demonstrates that law enforcement is actively pursuing cybercriminals, even those with legitimate cybersecurity credentials. Organizations must remain vigilant and continue to invest in robust security measures, incident response capabilities, and insider threat programs.
