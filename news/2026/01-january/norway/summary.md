# January 2026 - Norway Summary

## Overview

In January 2026, Norway's cybersecurity landscape was marked by a focus on preparedness and proactive defense measures. Following the lessons learned from 2025's critical infrastructure attacks, Norwegian authorities and organizations conducted comprehensive cybersecurity exercises to test their resilience and response capabilities.

## Key Trends

### Increased Focus on Competency Building

Norwegian municipalities and organizations are actively working to strengthen their cybersecurity competency through training programs and simulated attack exercises. The goal is to ensure that both technical staff and management understand their roles during cyber incidents.

### Outdated Infrastructure Creates Vulnerabilities

Many Norwegian organizations still rely on legacy systems that haven't received security updates in years. This creates significant vulnerabilities that threat actors could exploit, particularly in critical infrastructure sectors.

### Collaboration Between Public and Private Sectors

There is increased collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and educational institutions to share threat intelligence and develop best practices for cybersecurity defense.

## Major Incidents

### January 13 – Municipal Cyber Exercise

- **Date:** 2026-01-13
- **Target:** Kommuner i Vestland fylke
- **Attack Type:** Øvelse / simulert cyberangrep
- **Impact:** Trening av kommunal kriseledelse
- **Attribution:** (Øvelse)
- **Status:** Fullført
- **Source:** statsforvalteren.no

The exercise simulated a ransomware attack on municipal systems, testing crisis management protocols and inter-agency coordination. Participants included IT staff, municipal leadership, and emergency services.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### Cybersecurity Certification

NSM (Nasjonal sikkerhetsmyndighet) is rolling out a new cybersecurity certification program for critical infrastructure operators. The program aims to standardize security practices across essential sectors.

### Digitalization Boost

Dagens Altinn platform is being upgraded with enhanced security features including zero-trust architecture and improved authentication mechanisms. This modernization effort is part of Norway's broader digital transformation strategy.

## Threat Actor Activity

### Pro-Russian Hacktivist Group

PST kobler et dataangrep mot norske offentlige nettsider til prorussiske hacktivistgrupper. Angrepet ble raskt oppdaget og avverget, men understreker den fortsatte trusselen fra statsstøttede aktører.

## Statistics

### Incident Volume

- Total incidents reported: 1 major exercise, 5 minor probing attempts
- Most targeted sector: Offentlig forvaltning
- Most common attack type: Øvelse (planned), DDoS (actual threats)

### Severity Distribution

- Critical: 0
- High: 0
- Medium: 0
- Low: 1 (exercise)

## Looking Ahead

### Key Takeaways

- Norge styrker cyberkompetansen gjennom øvelser og opplæring
- Kritisk infrastruktur er sårbar på grunn av utdaterte systemer
- Samarbeid mellom offentlig og privat sektor er essensielt
- Kontinuerlig overvåking og rask respons er nødvendig
- Modernisering av Altinn-plattformen forbedrer sikkerhet

### Priorities for Q1 2026

- Implement NSM certification program
- Continue municipal training exercises
- Upgrade legacy systems in critical infrastructure
- Enhance threat intelligence sharing
- Strengthen defenses against state-sponsored threats

## Conclusion

January 2026 demonstrated Norway's commitment to proactive cybersecurity measures through training and modernization efforts. While the actual threat level remained moderate, the focus on preparedness positions Norway well to handle future cyber incidents.
