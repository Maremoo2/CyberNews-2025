# January 2026 - Norway Summary

## Overview

In January 2026, Norway's cybersecurity landscape was marked by a focus on preparedness and proactive defense measures. Following the lessons learned from 2025's critical infrastructure attacks, Norwegian authorities and organizations conducted comprehensive cybersecurity exercises to test their resilience and response capabilities.

## Key Trends

### Increased Focus on Competency Building

Norwegian municipalities and organizations are actively working to strengthen their cybersecurity competency through training programs and simulated attack exercises. The goal is to ensure that both technical staff and management understand their roles during cyber incidents.

### Outdated Infrastructure Creates Vulnerabilities

Many Norwegian organizations still rely on legacy systems that haven't received security updates in years. This creates significant vulnerabilities that threat actors could exploit, particularly in critical infrastructure sectors.

### Collaboration Between Public and Private Sectors

There is increased collaboration between government agencies, private companies, and educational institutions to share threat intelligence and develop best practices for cybersecurity defense.

### AI Expansion Increases Attack Surface

Multiple industry leaders warned that rapid AI adoption is creating unmanaged sprawl across enterprise environments, increasing security blind spots and governance challenges.

### Cloud Services as Data Exfiltration Targets

Threat actors increasingly target enterprise cloud file-sharing platforms such as ShareFile, Nextcloud, and OwnCloud to steal corporate data at scale.

### Automation and Hardware-Accelerated Security

Vendors are integrating AI-driven security controls directly into hardware platforms, leveraging technologies such as NVIDIA BlueField and accelerated telemetry pipelines.

### Disinformation and Cyber Operations

Information vacuums during geopolitical operations continue to fuel disinformation campaigns, conspiracy narratives, and cyber-enabled influence operations.

### Workforce Disruption in Cybersecurity

AI adoption is reshaping traditional entry-level roles in cybersecurity and IT, accelerating demand for higher-level analytical and governance skills.

### AI-Driven Attack Enablement

Attackers increasingly leverage AI tools to automate reconnaissance, generate attack briefs, and scale social engineering campaigns using publicly available data.

### Threat-Led Defense Models Gain Momentum

Security teams are shifting toward threat-led defense strategies, prioritizing real-world adversary behavior over compliance-driven controls.

### Psychological and Organizational Cyber Risk

Rising stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals are increasingly recognized as operational risk factors that weaken defensive capabilities.

### Cloud Dependency and Systemic Risk

Cloud outages and centralized services pose growing risks to IoT ecosystems and always-connected devices, amplifying the impact of service disruptions.

### IoT and Out-of-Band Management Exposure

New generations of IP-based KVM and OOB management devices introduce additional attack surfaces if improperly secured.

### Developer Toolchains as an Attack Vector

Threat actors increasingly abuse IDEs, extensions, and developer tooling ecosystems to distribute malware through trusted workflows.

### Botnet Evolution Targeting Modern Web Frameworks

Botnets are expanding beyond IoT to exploit modern frameworks such as React and Next.js, enabling cryptomining and payload delivery at scale.

### Board-Level Cyber and AI Risk Awareness

Boards and executive leadership are being urged to treat AI-driven cyber risk as a strategic governance issue rather than a technical concern.

### Security Tool Sprawl and Platform Consolidation

Organizations continue to struggle with excessive security tooling, driving renewed interest in platform consolidation and XDR approaches.

### AI as an Expanding Identity and Abuse Vector

Agentic AI systems are increasingly treated as a new identity class, introducing challenges related to access control, lifecycle management, and accountability.

### Honeypots and Deception Technology Gain Relevance

Organizations are increasingly deploying deception-based defenses to detect and study targeted attacks before production systems are impacted.

### Third-Party and Supply Chain Exposure

Breaches at external vendors and service providers continue to expose downstream customers, reinforcing supply chain risk as a dominant threat vector.

### Governance and Regulatory Pressure on AI Platforms

European regulators are intensifying scrutiny of AI tools following misuse incidents, signaling stricter enforcement of platform accountability.

### Malware-as-a-Service Ecosystem Maturity

Commodity malware such as stealers and botnets continue to evolve, leveraging obfuscation and easy distribution through underground markets.

### AI Agents as an Insider Threat Vector

Security leaders increasingly warn that autonomous AI agents behave like privileged insiders, requiring new access controls, identity governance, and accountability frameworks.

### Cyber Sovereignty and Internet Fragmentation

Governments are asserting greater control over internet governance, cybersecurity norms, and digital infrastructure, challenging traditional multistakeholder models.

### Home Routers as Strategic Attack Surface

Consumer-grade routers are emerging as a frontline cyber battlefield, with nation-state and criminal actors exploiting weak defaults and large-scale deployment.

### Consolidation in the Cybersecurity Market

Large security vendors continue pursuing acquisitions to close visibility gaps and address tool sprawl driven by cloud and AI complexity.

## Major Incidents

### January 1 – Municipal Cyber Exercise

- **Date:** 2026-01-01
- **Target:** Kommuner i Vestland fylke
- **Attack Type:** Øvelse / simulert cyberangrep
- **Impact:** Trening av kommunal kriseledelse
- **Attribution:** (Øvelse)
- **Status:** Fullført
- **Source:** statsforvalteren.no

The exercise simulated a ransomware attack on municipal systems, testing crisis management protocols and inter-agency coordination. Participants included IT staff, municipal leadership, and emergency services.

## Legislation & Policy Updates

### Cybersecurity Certification

NSM (Nasjonal sikkerhetsmyndighet) is rolling out a new cybersecurity certification program for critical infrastructure operators. The program aims to standardize security practices across essential sectors.

### Digitalization Boost

Dagens Altinn platform is being upgraded with enhanced security features including zero-trust architecture and improved authentication mechanisms. This modernization effort is part of Norway's broader digital transformation strategy.

## Threat Actor Activity

### Pro-Russian Hacktivist Group

PST kobler et dataangrep mot norske offentlige nettsider til prorussiske hacktivistgrupper. Angrepet ble raskt oppdaget og avverget, men understreker den fortsatte trusselen fra statsstøttede aktører.

### Zestix

The threat actor Zestix has been linked to the sale of stolen corporate data obtained from compromised cloud file-sharing services.

### China-Linked APT Groups

Chinese state-linked cyber units continued sustained operations and development of advanced malware frameworks, including Rust-based payloads, to improve stealth and persistence.

### Russian Cybercriminal Groups

Russian-linked threat actors conducted coordinated malware campaigns using advanced social engineering techniques.

### UAC-0184

Russia-aligned threat actor UAC-0184 continued high-intensity intelligence collection operations against Ukrainian government and military targets using messaging platforms.

### Kimwolf Botnet Operators

Kimwolf botnet actors expanded their infrastructure by abusing exposed Android devices, monetizing access through proxy services and DDoS-for-hire offerings.

### RondoDox Botnet Operators

RondoDox botnet operators expanded their campaigns by exploiting React-based servers, deploying cryptominers and botnet payloads across enterprise and IoT environments.

### Commercial Spyware Ecosystem

Spyware vendors and associated executives remain under scrutiny as governments reassess sanctions, regulation, and accountability for surveillance technology misuse.
